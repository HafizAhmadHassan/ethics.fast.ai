title: Practical Data Ethics
---

Data ethics covers an incredibly broad range of topics, many of which are urgent, making headlines daily, and causing harm to real people right now. No single data ethics course could cover all of these topics.  This is confirmed by research: a meta-analysis of [over 100 syllabi on tech ethics](https://medium.com/@cfiesler/tech-ethics-curricula-a-collection-of-syllabi-3eedfb76be18), titled ["What do we teach when we teach tech ethics?"](https://cmci.colorado.edu/~cafi5706/SIGCSE2020_EthicsSyllabi.pdf) concluded there is *"a great deal of variability across tech ethics courses in terms of the content taught. However, the lack of consistency of content is not surprising considering the lack of standards in this space, and the disciplinary breadth of the syllabi we covered. This is not a bad thing."* (Fiesler et al 2019)

In this course, we will focus on topics that are both urgent and practical. In keeping with [my teaching philosophy](https://www.fast.ai/2016/10/08/teaching-philosophy/), we will begin with two active, real-world areas (disinformation and bias) to provide context and motivation, before stepping back in Lesson 3 to dig into foundations of data ethics.

This class was originally taught in-person at the [University of San Francisco Data Institute](https://www.usfca.edu/data-institute) in January-February 2020, for a diverse mix of working professionals from a range of backgrounds (as one of their [evening certificate courses](https://www.usfca.edu/data-institute/certificates)). There are no prerequisites for the course. This course is in no way intended to be exhaustive, but hopefully will provide useful context about how data misuse is impacting society, as well as practice in critical thinking skills and questions to ask.

## Topics covered:

1. Disinformation
2. Bias & Fairness
3. Ethical Foundations & Practical Tools
4. Privacy and surveillance
5. Our Ecosystem: Metrics, Venture Capital, and Losing the Forest for the Trees
6. Algorithmic Colonialism, and Next Steps

## Desired Learning Outcomes

1. Understand the impacts of data misuse, including unjust bias, surveillance, disinformation, and feedback loops. Understand the contributing factors to these impacts. Identify different types of bias.
2. Develop literacy in investigating how data and data-powered algorithms shape, constrain, and manipulate our commercial, civic, and personal experiences.
3. Analyze new scenarios and potential products to try to identify and mitigate potential risks.
4. Have a toolkit of ethical techniques and practices to implement in their workplaces
