title: Practical Data Ethics
---

Data ethics covers an incredibly broad range of topics, many of which are urgent, impacting society and making headlines, and causing harm to real people right now. No single data ethics course could cover all of these topics.


As data ethics covers a broad and varied group of topics, there is no way that a 6-week (or even full semester length) course can be comprehensive.  A meta-analysis of over 100 syllabi on tech ethics, What Do We Teach When We Teach Tech Ethics? A Syllabi Analysis, found: “a great deal of variability across tech ethics courses in terms of the content taught. However, the lack of consistency of content is not surprising considering the lack of standards in this space, and the disciplinary breadth of the syllabi we covered. This is not a bad thing.” (Fiesler et al 2019)

In this course, we will focus on topics that are both urgent and practical (impacting real people right now).  In keeping with my teaching philosophy, we will begin with two active, real-world areas (disinformation and bias) to provide context and motivation, before stepping back in Week 3 to dig into foundations of data ethics.

Topics for this course:
Week 1: Disinformation
Week 2: Bias & Fairness
Week 3: Ethical Foundations & Practical Tools
Week 4: How did we get here? Our Ecosystem
Week 5: Privacy and surveillance
Week 6: Algorithmic Colonialism, and Next Steps
