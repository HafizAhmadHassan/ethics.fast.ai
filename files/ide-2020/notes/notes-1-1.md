# Lesson 1: Disinformation 

## Overview

From deepfakes being used to harass women, widespread misinformation about coronavirus (labeled an "infodemic" by the WHO), fears about the role disinformation could play in the 2020 election, and news of extensive foreign influence operations, disinformation is in the news frequently and is an urgent issue. It is also indicative of the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of so many data ethics issues: disinformation involves tech design choices, bad actors, human psychology, misaligned financial incentives, and more.

This outlines the work of Mike Caulfied on simple, yet often counter-intuitive approaches for users.

He has done a lot to bring attention to issues with recommendation systems. For a counter view on the role of recommendation systems, see Rebecca Lewis’s work below.
- Rachelle Hampton, [The Black Feminists Who Saw the Alt-Right Threat Coming](https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/black-feminists-alt-right-twitter-gamergate.html): This provides some helpful history on a 2014 case of fraudulent accounts and coordinated manipulation, with techniques that would go on to be widely used in future disinformation campaigns.
