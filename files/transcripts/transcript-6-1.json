  "10:51": "malaria is a problem and so I think some",
  "10:56": "of these I think are probably kind of",
  "10:57": "harder projects to evaluate you know are",
  "11:01": "these kind of positive or negative and I",
  "11:04": "I thought this was a very thoughtful",
  "11:05": "article kind of exploring what are some",
  "11:08": "of the downsides I think particularly I",
  "11:11": "know in the past I have not always been",
  "11:14": "critical enough around data for good",
  "11:17": "projects or the idea of the kind of the",
  "11:19": "positive potential there but recognising",
  "11:22": "the the risk and downsides and so here",
  "11:26": "they give kind of an overview of many of",
  "11:28": "the countries that have had various so",
  "11:32": "and this is where kind of cellphone data",
  "11:34": "is collected from the carrier",
  "11:37": "it is technically technically anonymized",
  "11:39": "although as we've kind of seen",
  "11:41": "previously you know their concerns of",
  "11:45": "this data really ever anonymized can it",
  "11:48": "be d anonymized so for a few examples in",
  "11:54": "Turkey international teams tracked",
  "11:57": "Syrian refugees Nepal they tracked",
  "12:00": "people after the 2015 earthquake Sierra",
  "12:06": "Leone they analyzed call records to an",
  "12:11": "examined travel restrictions during the",
  "12:13": "Ebola outbreak of 2014 to 2016",
  "12:16": "and so some of the concerns are there's",
  "12:19": "a lack of consent here this is typically",
  "12:21": "I think something that people do not",
  "12:23": "have any choice about whether whether",
  "12:25": "there are opting in or not there's the",
  "12:28": "potential for breaches of privacy even",
  "12:30": "from anonymize datasets there's the",
  "12:34": "possibility of misuse by a commercial or",
  "12:36": "government entities interested in",
  "12:38": "surveillance and then the kind of this",
  "12:41": "question of are the results even being",
  "12:43": "used in many cases kind of the you know",
  "12:46": "the conclusions may be interesting but",
  "12:48": "are they actually kind of making their",
  "12:50": "way into policy or structural changes",
  "12:55": "and are there other ways to gather this",
  "12:58": "data because in many cases also the data",
  "13:00": "necessarily I think they give an example",
  "13:03": "of you know discovering that refugees",
  "13:05": "were isolated which you know perhaps",
  "13:08": "they didn't need all these phone records",
  "13:10": "to discover would there be ways to kind",
  "13:12": "of survey people in a way where consent",
  "13:15": "is is clearer and more more upfront are",
  "13:18": "there kneeing kind of thoughts or",
  "13:19": "reactions to this article Elise yeah",
  "13:26": "yeah what I was sort of thinking about I",
  "13:30": "said start this thought about so like",
  "13:33": "back in my research group we like we",
  "13:37": "have like this database of all the",
  "13:38": "people that have been affiliated with",
  "13:39": "the group and I realized when I was",
  "13:41": "digging around in the database for some",
  "13:43": "reason that was a column of like gender",
  "13:45": "and it sort of raised all of these kinds",
  "13:48": "of questions which were like gender",
  "13:50": "identity is a really personal thing",
  "13:52": "let's move not totally relevant to the",
  "13:55": "research group and so it's questionable",
  "13:58": "why we were why we even have that column",
  "14:00": "it was like generally empty for",
  "14:02": "everybody but still the implications",
  "14:04": "that we wanted to collect that data",
  "14:05": "forever reason and like part of the",
  "14:08": "results even being used there could be",
  "14:10": "an argument that like we could be using",
  "14:12": "that if we collected it so think about",
  "14:14": "whether we have gender parity in the",
  "14:15": "group or what-have-you but we weren't",
  "14:18": "doing that so it was sort of just like",
  "14:20": "performative Lea sort of setting",
  "14:22": "ourselves up to cut data no don't tend",
  "14:24": "to use it in a useful way or an",
  "14:26": "instructor foot and",
  "14:29": "yeah so the thing there were it sort of",
  "14:30": "raised all these questions like okay",
  "14:31": "well like maybe vaguely you can just",
  "14:34": "search with something useful or positive",
  "14:36": "but this isn't actually happening that",
  "14:39": "way and if somebody's like my Mary or",
  "14:42": "something then like that information",
  "14:45": "particular getting sort of like leaked",
  "14:47": "could be it could major them in a really",
  "14:50": "serious way if they're traveling to",
  "14:52": "another country or have you so like it",
  "14:54": "just raises all of these issues or like",
  "14:57": "and also costs us a lot of energy and",
  "14:59": "effort to maintain this information to",
  "15:01": "say nothing of lighting we're not using",
  "15:03": "a penny constructive positive yes so",
  "15:06": "like what's what was the point of all",
  "15:08": "this at hurt and struggle oh yeah like",
  "15:10": "it it really raised this like sort of it",
  "15:13": "reminds me of that of that issue where",
  "15:15": "it was like there's all of this stuff",
  "15:17": "going on Barbie and all of this cool",
  "15:20": "thank you that's a great example I",
  "15:25": "should highlight something else they",
  "15:27": "talked about the article was in the",
  "15:29": "example of malaria where they were",
  "15:30": "tracking the kind of migration of people",
  "15:32": "to an area where malaria was a bigger",
  "15:35": "risk some people that work on malaria",
  "15:38": "pointed out like we already have all",
  "15:39": "these interventions that we know we work",
  "15:41": "like mosquito nets and pesticide that",
  "15:44": "aren't necessarily getting enough",
  "15:45": "support or funding you know do we need",
  "15:48": "kind of this fancy data project like as",
  "15:51": "this yielding results compared to things",
  "15:54": "that may seem kind of less less exciting",
  "15:57": "but are proven and kind of under",
  "15:59": "underfunded let me check the group chat",
  "16:05": "Oh a lot of a lot of comments",
  "16:19": "all right so I saw a read some of the",
  "16:26": "comments from the the group chat and",
  "16:29": "there's a comment that the live chat is",
  "16:31": "finicky without the growth of AI we",
  "16:34": "wouldn't have Africa's and dhaba acts",
  "16:36": "Latin America's Kapoor yeah so there are",
  "16:39": "some kind of great local movements",
  "16:45": "someone says I'm not surprised its",
  "16:47": "Huawei given the Chinese government",
  "16:49": "effort in monopolizing data yeah sure do",
  "16:55": "what that I was thinking about last week",
  "17:02": "on a CIA cia-backed surveillance by the",
  "17:11": "company that operated from like in a",
  "17:14": "world war 2 through 2018 Wow",
  "17:17": "fascinating and there was a Swiss",
  "17:19": "company there was also a clergy",
  "17:22": "intelligence and so pretty much what",
  "17:26": "they said and it soon felt cyber 8 or",
  "17:28": "crypto 80s porn directly on the detect",
  "17:32": "that we used to you know cryptography in",
  "17:35": "world war ii and and it was it was very",
  "17:38": "similar to what was described not huawei",
  "17:40": "they weren't like to attack and people",
  "17:43": "like Carter during the Egypt and it's",
  "17:45": "really the good peace negotiations was",
  "17:46": "getting direct information about what",
  "17:49": "the difference I was saying it like it",
  "17:51": "continued all wow yeah and I look that",

  "18:14": "in mind that is a good question I don't",
  "18:17": "know of any like there's no company that",
  "18:20": "I am familiar with and think of is like",
  "18:22": "oh there are a great example of",
  "18:24": "anti-colonialism I don't know if anybody",
  "18:27": "has one feel free to to share and that",

  "24:44": "I got a really interesting study where",
  "24:45": "they they gave participants two",

  "24:50": "New York Times article about a class",
  "24:54": "action lawsuit against a company by",
  "24:57": "female employees for discrimination and",
  "25:00": "in one one version they had an extra",

  "25:04": "selected by you know working mother is a",
  "25:07": "great place to work and the other they",
  "25:09": "didn't and then they kind of asked",
  "25:11": "people how valid do you think the the",
  "25:13": "woman's complaints are against the",
  "25:15": "company for discrimination and if the",
  "25:17": "company had this you know accolade from",
  "25:20": "working mother even though there was",

  "25:23": "people were less likely to believe the",
  "25:26": "woman who had experienced discrimination",
  "25:28": "and there was a kind of similar study or",
  "25:31": "similar group where they looked at a",

  "25:35": "statement about diversity to its company",
  "25:38": "mission or company value statement and",
  "25:41": "then asked people do you believe this",

  "25:47": "less likely to believe it",
  "25:49": "if the if the company had diversity is",
  "25:52": "one of its values and so this is uh I",
  "25:55": "think some a way that this can be very",
  "25:58": "harmful and companies claim to care",
  "26:01": "about something or start kind of",
  "26:02": "branding themselves that way without",
  "26:04": "necessarily kind of doing the work to",
  "26:07": "improve their conditions and in some",
  "26:12": "forms of unconscious bias training",
  "26:13": "increased bias as well and so and this",
  "26:17": "is none of this is an argument like",
  "26:19": "blanket argument against diversity",
  "26:23": "programs or bias training but it's that",
  "26:25": "you have to be incredibly thoughtful",
  "26:28": "about it and I think there are people",
  "26:30": "that are doing it well but I think",
  "26:31": "they're also people that kind of not",
  "26:33": "doing it well is worse than not doing it",
  "26:35": "at all because it can have the opposite",
  "26:37": "effect and can also kind of inspire a",
  "26:39": "kind of backlash or retaliation if",
  "26:43": "there's not kind of the right structures",
  "26:45": "in place and kind of like full",
  "26:47": "commitment around it any questions about",
  "26:50": "this",
  "26:53": "and so I think there's a kind of a very",
  "26:56": "real risk that we'll see this with with",
  "26:58": "data ethics issues but again I don't",
  "27:07": "want to kind of undermine the people",
  "27:09": "that are doing good work and and",
  "27:10": "genuinely genuinely care alright so how",
  "27:16": "about ethics principles so there are a",
  "27:19": "huge number of ethics principles and I",
  "27:23": "meant to look up the exact number this",
  "27:25": "was a survey though I think of you over",
  "27:27": "over 30 different sets of AI ethics",
  "27:30": "principles and so I think at this point",
  "27:34": "it's helpful and then this was",
  "27:36": "interesting to look at kind of they're",
  "27:38": "looking at the similarities across",
  "27:39": "different ones and some of these come",
  "27:41": "from civil society some are from",
  "27:44": "governments from companies very so also",
  "27:47": "kind of different how they describe it",
  "27:49": "multi-stakeholder kind of different",
  "27:51": "groups so at this point though I do",
  "27:53": "think we probably have too many",
  "27:57": "different sets of ethics principles I",
  "27:59": "don't know that anyone needs to go and",
  "28:00": "go create their own their own set and I",
  "28:04": "think there is you know there's some",
  "28:05": "potential of how these can be used to",
  "28:08": "potentially create a system for kind of",
  "28:12": "accountability or how you even discuss",
  "28:14": "decision making there are downsides as",
  "28:17": "well though and there was a really",
  "28:19": "interesting paper by this group in AI",
  "28:23": "yes a year or two ago and they they",
  "28:27": "argue that many of the principles",
  "28:29": "proposed in AI ethics are too broad to",
  "28:31": "be useful rather than representing the",
  "28:34": "outcome of a meaningful debate on how AI",
  "28:36": "should be developed they may even",
  "28:37": "postpone it",
  "28:38": "and I think this is a very very valid",
  "28:40": "concern but I think when we have kind of",
  "28:42": "you know broad principles like me look",
  "28:46": "at some of the ones here you know",
  "28:47": "promoting human values being responsible",
  "28:50": "fairness accountability most people are",
  "28:53": "not going to say that they're against",
  "28:55": "these things but then there are all",
  "28:56": "sorts of kind of justifications that you",
  "28:59": "know this hasn't necessarily determined",
  "29:01": "you know should should law enforcement",
  "29:04": "be using face tumor",
  "29:05": "ignition or kind of a more concrete",
  "29:06": "question and that if we kind of spend",
  "29:09": "too long on kind of like the high level",
  "29:11": "or these kind of broader broader",
  "29:13": "principles we may be postponing kind of",
  "29:18": "the nitty-gritty discussion of what does",
  "29:20": "this mean in practice on kind of",
  "29:22": "particular uses and whether they should",
  "29:24": "be allowed or not and so I thought that",
  "29:26": "was kind of a good warning and this is",
  "29:28": "this is an interesting paper to read",
  "29:34": "next let me just check the whoops the",
  "29:37": "group chat so there was a question did I",
  "29:42": "say that diversity and inclusion",
  "29:44": "training can increase conflict or not",
  "29:46": "work and so I know saying is that in",
  "29:48": "some cases it has the opposite impact",
  "29:52": "from desired which is kind of even worse",
  "29:54": "than not working there was also I should",
  "29:58": "have I should have shared it Y Yvonne",
  "30:01": "Hutchinson who does is kind of founder",
  "30:03": "of a she's a former international human",
  "30:07": "rights lawyer and founder of a kind of",
  "30:09": "diversity and inclusion consulting group",
  "30:11": "had a really great thread on situations",
  "30:14": "where she refuses to do diversity",
  "30:16": "inclusion training because she thinks it",
  "30:18": "would make the situation worse and that",
  "30:21": "I will find that and post that in the",
  "30:23": "forums because that was really fantastic",
  "30:25": "on this topic of when DNI training",
  "30:28": "doesn't work and she gave an example of",
  "30:32": "police force where there was kind of",
  "30:34": "well documented issues with racism and",
  "30:38": "somebody did kind of racial unconscious",
  "30:41": "bias training and she points out that a",
  "30:43": "their issues weren't even about",
  "30:44": "unconscious bias they're about kind of",
  "30:46": "very blatant racism also that there was",
  "30:48": "no change to kind of the power",
  "30:49": "structures there's no accountability for",
  "30:51": "the people involved and in that sort of",
  "30:54": "scenario there was actually a lot of",
  "30:56": "vitriol against the person that did the",
  "30:59": "training that that kind of that person",
  "31:01": "had been set up to fail and that was a",
  "31:03": "situation where it really was kind of",
  "31:05": "just gonna increase resentment to not",
  "31:07": "actually address their underlying",
  "31:08": "problems so I'll find that thread and",
  "31:11": "link to it because that was that was",
  "31:12": "great",
  "31:13": "back to principles let's go do a case",
  "31:18": "study and so this is adapted from Chris",
  "31:23": "Wiggins and Matt Jones and so they have",
  "31:26": "mentioned this previously they have a",
  "31:28": "course at Columbia called data past",
  "31:30": "present and future and Chris Wiggins is",
  "31:33": "a applied math professor and chief data",
  "31:36": "scientist of New York Times and",
  "31:38": "Christian or Matt Jones is a history",
  "31:41": "professor and so kind of one of the",
  "31:45": "incidences they look at is the Tuskegee",
  "31:49": "syphilis trial which is just terrible so",
  "31:51": "this was something that went on for 40",
  "31:53": "years of just observing untreated",
  "31:55": "syphilis and african-american men even",
  "31:58": "though penicillin was discovered as an",
  "32:00": "effective treatment in the 40s",
  "32:04": "participants were not we're not even",
  "32:06": "told that they had syphilis and they",
  "32:07": "were not given kind of this well-known",
  "32:09": "effective treatment treatment and in",
  "32:14": "1972 a whistleblower contacted the press",
  "32:18": "in 1974 and response so there's kind of",
  "32:21": "been a big public outcry about just",
  "32:23": "ahead of how horribly unethical this had",
  "32:25": "been Congress passed the National",
  "32:27": "Research Act which led to the Belmont",
  "32:31": "principles and so and this is kind of",
  "32:36": "the the basis for IR B's institutional",
  "32:40": "review boards at universities now and so",
  "32:43": "this I think is a very entire B's are",
  "32:47": "not perfect but they have definitely a",
  "32:49": "big improvement on not having them and",
  "32:52": "this was a really kind of effective I",
  "32:54": "think implementation of moving from",
  "32:56": "principles to a format of accountability",
  "33:00": "and something that Chris highlights is",
  "33:02": "the reason that this worked is because",
  "33:06": "universities were reliant on federal",
  "33:08": "funding and by having the funding tied",
  "33:11": "to kind of following these principles",
  "33:14": "and having an IRB that that that lover",
  "33:17": "of power is what made this possible so",
  "33:19": "it's not something that you could just",
  "33:21": "implement in kind of any situation you",
  "33:25": "need to have the lover of power and",
  "33:28": "accountability to make something like",
  "33:29": "this work this is kind of a positive",
  "33:32": "case study though of of people and",
  "33:35": "people spent years kind of coming up",
  "33:37": "with you know what",
  "33:39": "what should the principles of ethical",
  "33:41": "medical research be and then one of",
  "33:43": "those looks like in practice and then",
  "33:45": "this has been very well studied it was",
  "33:46": "kind of how well is this working when",
  "33:48": "it's been operationalized and time for",
  "33:50": "this is a bit of a successful case study",
  "33:54": "of kind of something terribly unethical",
  "33:57": "but then kind of people people",
  "34:00": "responding any any thoughts or comments",
  "34:04": "on this and then I'm linking to their",
  "34:06": "course again all their materials are",
  "34:08": "online if you wanted to to check out",
  "34:10": "more about about this or other other",
  "34:13": "kind of incidences and advances in",
  "34:15": "history and how they how they related to",
  "34:18": "data and power let me check the the",
  "34:25": "talkative group in the chat as a",
  "34:29": "discussion about D&I training not",
  "34:31": "working",
  "34:33": "yeah eager this.d and I can be used to",
  "34:36": "paper over real ongoing problems with",
  "34:38": "bad actors no one wants to confront this",
  "34:42": "is a great comment dni training centers",
  "34:46": "privileged folk folks experience and",
  "34:49": "discussions and as a person of color it",
  "34:50": "can be precarious to navigate",
  "34:52": "effectively without casting yourself in",
  "34:54": "a negative light or getting saddled with",
  "34:56": "extra unpaid work fixing the problem you",
  "34:59": "bring up in discussion and there is an",
  "35:00": "agreement on that yes I think those are",
  "35:03": "very very valid critiques of of DNI",
  "35:07": "training and I think there are people",
  "35:09": "out there that do it well but you have",
  "35:12": "to also I think really have the people",
  "35:14": "in power on board and be interested in",
  "35:17": "making structural changes and kind of",
  "35:18": "very thoughtful about it and another",
  "35:22": "comment even saying that diversity and",
  "35:25": "inclusion isn't working as a person of",
  "35:26": "color makes one seem like a cantankerous",
  "35:28": "spoilsport",
  "35:33": "yeah so thank you for that everyone on",
  "35:35": "the group chat oh and then I was going",
  "35:41": "to note I did a post on the fast day I",
  "35:44": "blog that I were I interviewed Chris",
  "35:46": "Wiggins and he talked talk some more",
  "35:48": "about this kind of another example of",
  "35:58": "moving towards kind of ethical",
  "36:00": "principles and rights would be the",
  "36:02": "Universal Declaration of Human Rights",
  "36:04": "which was adopted in 1948 by the the",
  "36:08": "United Nations and I should note this is",
  "36:10": "not Universal this was kind of just the",
  "36:13": "countries that were in the UN 48 of the",
  "36:16": "50 country 58 countries in the UN at the",
  "36:18": "time voted in favor men voted against",
  "36:21": "but this has often been elaborated in",
  "36:24": "international treaties and some national",
  "36:26": "constitutions so this is kind of an",
  "36:29": "example of one way of kind of trying to",
  "36:32": "put rights into a format and it's",
  "36:35": "something I think particularly in Europe",
  "36:37": "you know if there's a country that's",
  "36:40": "seen as not or you know seen as",
  "36:43": "violating human rights can be brought up",
  "36:45": "in kind of some international courts any",
  "36:51": "any questions or thoughts Oh Claudia no",
  "36:56": "someone wanted patches the past of the",
  "36:57": "catch box back cool thank you",
  "37:06": "so when is it going to yeah I mean I",
  "37:17": "think it's it's hard that's a great",
  "37:20": "question yeah so when will this be",
  "37:21": "implemented for data can it be",
  "37:24": "I'll see more about this in a moment I",
  "37:26": "do think we're in the kind of earlier",
  "37:28": "phases of even deciding like what are",
  "37:32": "how do we properly kind of frame the the",
  "37:35": "rights that we're trying to protect and",
  "37:38": "then there is also the issue of getting",
  "37:42": "getting the buy-in from countries and",
  "37:46": "kind of the levers of power of how do",
  "37:47": "you go about enforcing this and so like",
  "37:50": "the the Declaration of Human Rights",
  "37:53": "really you know grew very much out of",
  "37:55": "kind of World War two in post-world War",
  "37:58": "two conditions of even to kind of reach",
  "38:01": "this sort of agreement on on what sort",
  "38:03": "of rights do we want to protect and",
  "38:07": "codify so I do think we have a ways to",
  "38:09": "go with with data",
  "38:12": "oh no yeah I think we could implement",
  "38:25": "regulations like I think individual",
  "38:27": "country or even individual states like",
  "38:29": "we're seeing with and someone brought up",
  "38:32": "CCPA the California in California I was",
  "38:36": "kidding me remember what oh you had like",
  "38:39": "downloaded a new app and there was a",
  "38:41": "screen and it was like you know this app",
  "38:43": "is gonna track you unless you live in",
  "38:45": "California you can opt out and that was",
  "38:47": "alike oh this is such a you know this is",
  "38:50": "like nice to have this concrete moment",
  "38:52": "of like I could and it was still kind of",
  "38:54": "annoying to like you go get your device",
  "38:56": "ID that you can enter and submit this",
  "38:58": "form so it is something that I think",
  "39:00": "like states can implement kind of",
  "39:05": "particular localities in terms of and",
  "39:10": "this is in particular talking about the",
  "39:11": "the arm of regulation which is just one",
  "39:16": "way of addressing data ethics although I",
  "39:17": "do think it's a particularly in",
  "39:19": "Fortin way of addressing data ethics",
  "39:23": "yeah I don't have a good answer for that",
