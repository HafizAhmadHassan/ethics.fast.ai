  "00:00": "I mean I hate everyone welcome back and",
  "00:04": "so now we're gonna have a special mini",
  "00:07": "guest lecture by Olli al-khatib who is",
  "00:09": "our data ethics fellow he was also the",
  "00:13": "author of one of the assigned readings",
  "00:15": "for this week and so losing of a",
  "00:18": "presentation and then I have a kind of",
  "00:20": "week five person tation that I will",
  "00:21": "start after that and this will probably",
  "00:23": "go into next week some kind of my",
  "00:25": "presentation which is fine clearly we",
  "00:26": "have extra time there but here's Ali",
  "00:33": "[Applause]",
  "00:34": "thanks everyone",
  "00:36": "save it until after Hey",
  "00:40": "so I want to talk a little bit about",
  "00:43": "some thoughts that have been sort of",
  "00:45": "knocking around in my head lately and it",
  "00:47": "sort of starts with this book seeing",
  "00:49": "like a state by a guy named James Scott",
  "00:52": "in the book seeing like a state Scott",
  "00:56": "makes this argument that governments",
  "00:57": "basically make sense of the world by",
  "00:59": "operationalizing it in certain ways to",
  "01:01": "allow them to make comparisons and",
  "01:03": "decisions and they do this in ways that",
  "01:05": "are pretty intuitive are familiar to us",
  "01:07": "like they standardized how we make sense",
  "01:10": "the family names how they how we",
  "01:12": "instantiate sort of measures so that we",
  "01:15": "can exchange and trade how to do surveys",
  "01:19": "and censuses which is a topic of",
  "01:20": "controversy this year in particular how",
  "01:24": "we organize our transportation like",
  "01:26": "where stops are Wed and stops are just",
  "01:29": "so that we can get around and a lot of",
  "01:32": "this is to make the world which is a",
  "01:34": "really messy place legible to a state",
  "01:36": "which is which sort of thrives on order",
  "01:39": "and being able to make sense of things",
  "01:42": "in a clear and coherent way but they",
  "01:45": "also scaffold power and this is sort of",
  "01:48": "clear in a lot of different ways but",
  "01:50": "like one of the ways that was really",
  "01:51": "salient to me when I was reading this",
  "01:53": "book was that there's this idea of like",
  "01:56": "what's your domain like California is",
  "01:59": "one domain that has the governance and",
  "02:01": "all this other stuff but it also says",
  "02:03": "what's not part of the domain and just",
  "02:06": "in doing that just in sayings for",
  "02:08": "instance where the boundary is which is",
  "02:09": "this really fuzzy difficult to sort of",
  "02:11": "articulate thing in the real world",
  "02:13": "it implicitly also starts to build up",
  "02:16": "what are the powers of a state beyond",
  "02:18": "sort of establishing its boundaries and",
  "02:20": "all of these other things there are lots",
  "02:22": "of other ways that sort of regimented",
  "02:25": "the ways that we make sense of the world",
  "02:27": "help scaffold power for for governments",
  "02:30": "but I think the underlying point here is",
  "02:32": "that we in general people make sense of",
  "02:35": "the world and make sense of the world",
  "02:37": "and interpret the world in really",
  "02:38": "constrained ways and we do it because",
  "02:40": "it's how we cope with way too much",
  "02:42": "information and this was really salient",
  "02:45": "again to me in the book because one of",
  "02:48": "the stories that he talks about is that",
  "02:50": "during the Industrial Revolution there",
  "02:52": "were all these forests this is actually",
  "02:53": "a screenshot of like I think Lake Tahoe",
  "02:55": "so not what he was talking about but in",
  "02:58": "the Industrial Revolution Europeans",
  "03:00": "wanted to make sense of how many trees",
  "03:02": "there were in the forest so they could",
  "03:04": "harvest trees and not totally destroy",
  "03:05": "their forest the forest sort of ecology",
  "03:08": "and what they realized was that they",
  "03:10": "could count a little subset of the trees",
  "03:11": "and they would be able to sort of",
  "03:13": "extrapolate from there a lot of this",
  "03:15": "stuff if you've taken introductory",
  "03:16": "statistics is the sort of stuff that",
  "03:18": "they were building and sort of like",
  "03:19": "constructing in statistical sort of",
  "03:22": "methods at this time but they also",
  "03:24": "realized that if they organized and",
  "03:26": "regimented the world in really",
  "03:28": "constrained ways it would make it easier",
  "03:30": "for them to reason and think about it so",
  "03:32": "what they did was like they uprooted all",
  "03:34": "of these trees and they like replanted",
  "03:35": "them so that all like a lot of these",
  "03:37": "trees all of the trees in this photo",
  "03:39": "were the same species Norway spruce if",
  "03:42": "anybody's curious and the same age they",
  "03:45": "were organized and are really kind of",
  "03:47": "like obsessively clean a neat way and",
  "03:50": "Scott talked about this idea of",
  "03:53": "basically high modernism this idea not",
  "03:56": "just that like geometrically clear and",
  "03:58": "sort of like geometrically clean sort of",
  "04:01": "patterns are satisfying to people but",
  "04:04": "that like there's a moral value to it",
  "04:06": "that this is actually sort of like",
  "04:08": "morally ethically good to make things",
  "04:11": "sort of like clear and clean for people",
  "04:13": "to reason about and make sense of so",
  "04:15": "this this is sort of this turning the",
  "04:17": "interpretation of the world a very",
  "04:19": "constrained very geometrically patterned",
  "04:20": "very clear sort of world into the",
  "04:23": "imposition of it like actually uprooting",
  "04:25": "entire forests and reap",
  "04:27": "them and this was fine for a while but",
  "04:30": "then about 70 or 80 years later it",
  "04:33": "wasn't so fine a number of things",
  "04:35": "happened that caused serious",
  "04:37": "catastrophes first pests when you change",
  "04:41": "the entire forest to be one species",
  "04:43": "pests go they love it like they have a",
  "04:46": "field day",
  "04:47": "because Norway spruce isn't particularly",
  "04:49": "sort of resilient against certain kinds",
  "04:51": "of pests and those pests just went crazy",
  "04:53": "there were storms in the previous photo",
  "04:56": "you saw that all the trees were roughly",
  "04:57": "the same age they were roughly the same",
  "04:58": "height they're roughly the same sort of",
  "05:00": "mass and when big storms came through",
  "05:03": "rather than the big trees sort of",
  "05:04": "blocking the winds and the rains and the",
  "05:06": "storms in for the sort of defense of the",
  "05:10": "smaller trees all of these trees that",
  "05:12": "were basically the same age got kind of",
  "05:14": "destroyed all at once and then there was",
  "05:16": "the hollowing out of the ecosystem",
  "05:18": "itself is as part of the sort of",
  "05:20": "cleaning of the forest people got rid of",
  "05:23": "the underbrush they got rid of the",
  "05:24": "passing sort of fauna and flora they",
  "05:28": "basically turned the forest into just",
  "05:31": "trees and as a result of that it turns",
  "05:33": "out those animals and those insects and",
  "05:37": "those plants were necessary as part of",
  "05:39": "like the ongoing total holistic ecology",
  "05:43": "of the system and so what happened was",
  "05:46": "what they called vaults turbine which",
  "05:48": "turns out to me in forests death and",
  "05:51": "that's kind of terrifying",
  "05:52": "they lost something like 30 to 60",
  "05:55": "percent of the forests before they",
  "05:56": "realized what was going on before a",
  "05:58": "national campaign to rebuild the forest",
  "06:01": "and introduce spiders and insects and",
  "06:03": "all of the other pieces of wildlife back",
  "06:06": "into the forest to try to bring it back",
  "06:08": "from the brink of death were ultimately",
  "06:09": "successful but it was it was close and",
  "06:12": "it was scary it turned out that the",
  "06:15": "forest was more than just the trees it",
  "06:17": "was everything that lived in and passed",
  "06:19": "through that entire sphere okay so why",
  "06:24": "did I tell you about trees just now I",
  "06:26": "think that narratives matter and I think",
  "06:28": "that it's important how we frame and",
  "06:29": "make sense of this stuff because it",
  "06:31": "helps us make sense of where we should",
  "06:33": "be going and where we are so in this",
  "06:37": "talk which hopefully I won't go over on",
  "06:40": "I think that I want to make three kind",
  "06:43": "of major arguments the first being that",
  "06:46": "we turn our really messy world into data",
  "06:48": "to reason about it and to inform our",
  "06:50": "actions second that that's becoming a",
  "06:54": "growing problem as we build systems",
  "06:55": "directly out of data and then third that",
  "06:59": "people respond to that and that I think",
  "07:01": "where we're going is that people are",
  "07:03": "starting to perform for the algorithms",
  "07:05": "that dictate and direct our lives and",
  "07:06": "I'm worried about where that's going to",
  "07:08": "lead us so there are these three sort of",
  "07:10": "arguments that I'm going to make I'm not",
  "07:12": "totally sure how I feel about any or all",
  "07:14": "of them and so I'm curious what all of",
  "07:15": "your thoughts are but let's get started",
  "07:18": "with the first one where we've been",
  "07:20": "turning the messy world into clean sort",
  "07:23": "of data to whatever extent that data is",
  "07:26": "even clean or accurate okay so this is",
  "07:31": "part of the sort of narrative history",
  "07:33": "sort of thing how many of you have just",
  "07:35": "by a show of hands have heard of the",
  "07:36": "mother of all demos okay interesting if",
  "07:40": "you're not familiar the mother of all",
  "07:43": "demos was sort of this demonstration",
  "07:45": "about in 1968 but yeah of course on the",
  "07:48": "screen in 1968 that introduced a lot of",
  "07:52": "the paradigms that you are probably",
  "07:53": "using on your computers right now the",
  "07:55": "idea of like a text cursor of",
  "07:57": "teleconferencing of just editing text in",
  "08:01": "general like this was introduced here in",
  "08:03": "like an hour and a half long demo that",
  "08:05": "had never been seen before and many",
  "08:09": "people in computer science and in",
  "08:10": "engineering and talk about it as the",
  "08:12": "beginning of user interface paradigms",
  "08:13": "that have influenced the world for the",
  "08:15": "next 50 60 probably will be the next",
  "08:18": "hundred years but a different",
  "08:21": "perspective on that is that this is the",
  "08:22": "conclusion of a decade of military",
  "08:24": "research a decade of research that was",
  "08:26": "funded by the military during the Cold",
  "08:28": "War to figure out how to bomb places",
  "08:30": "more effectively and more efficiently",
  "08:33": "now you could reasonably ask why this",
  "08:37": "matters and the reason I think that it",
  "08:39": "matters is because less than 50 years",
  "08:41": "later 30 years less than 30 years later",
  "08:44": "John Perry Barlow wrote the Declaration",
  "08:46": "of Independence of Spira sorry the",
  "08:48": "Declaration of the independence of",
  "08:50": "cyberspace where he talked about this",
  "08:52": "idea that we have no elected government",
  "08:54": "or we likely to have one that",
  "08:55": "governments derive their powers from the",
  "08:56": "consent of the governed and that within",
  "08:58": "that we haven't given that to them and",
  "09:00": "he he wrote this like on the internet",
  "09:02": "and posted it onto the onto a network",
  "09:06": "that was built by government funding",
  "09:08": "that was built by military funding um",
  "09:10": "and so I don't necessarily think that",
  "09:12": "like I would say that like this was a",
  "09:13": "huge sort of hypocritical like blunder",
  "09:16": "on his part but I think that it was",
  "09:17": "clearly not acknowledging the history",
  "09:21": "upon which he was building when he",
  "09:23": "talked about these ideas of the",
  "09:24": "Declaration of like a sort of breaking",
  "09:27": "away from from physical Geographic",
  "09:30": "embodied space and they think that that",
  "09:33": "sort of translates into where we are now",
  "09:34": "in this idea of kind of building human",
  "09:38": "centered AI you all have read about the",
  "09:42": "H AI there was the launch of the",
  "09:44": "Institute wait sorry the Stanford",
  "09:47": "Institute for human centered artificial",
  "09:48": "intelligence I wrote about it at length",
  "09:51": "I had thoughts but the real question and",
  "09:57": "the real issue that I wanted to talk",
  "09:58": "about with it with that post and that I",
  "10:00": "want to talk about now is that I have",
  "10:03": "real questions about what future we're",
  "10:06": "building with the stakeholders that are",
  "10:07": "in the room it at the H AI do they have",
  "10:10": "the knowledge do they have the",
  "10:11": "experience do they have the",
  "10:12": "methodological backgrounds do they have",
  "10:14": "the incentives even to solve any of",
  "10:16": "these problems I'm not totally sure that",
  "10:19": "they do and in fact it worried me to the",
  "10:20": "point that I couldn't continue to be",
  "10:23": "there anymore and I think that this is",
  "10:25": "becoming a growing problem as we",
  "10:26": "continue to build systems and as",
  "10:28": "artificial intelligence turns data that",
  "10:31": "we've collected and sort of aggregated",
  "10:34": "into into these systems themselves now",
  "10:38": "there are all sorts of examples of",
  "10:40": "artificial intelligence making really",
  "10:42": "frustrating stupid errors in judgment or",
  "10:45": "errors and misen classification or what",
  "10:47": "have you and we could go on and on and",
  "10:49": "on and on with all of the terrible",
  "10:53": "errors that these algorithmic systems",
  "10:55": "have made but I think it's sort of",
  "10:56": "empirically the case that these",
  "10:58": "algorithmic systems are taking data that",
  "11:00": "we've collected without being",
  "11:02": "particularly critically analytical about",
  "11:05": "what that data what those",
  "11:08": "say and sort of thrown them at these",
  "11:10": "systems and ask them to develop patterns",
  "11:12": "but I read about that in this paper",
  "11:14": "about street level algorithms if you're",
  "11:16": "curious there's the whole paper about it",
  "11:19": "but basically the gist is that",
  "11:20": "algorithmic systems look at look for",
  "11:23": "patterns in the data that we give it and",
  "11:25": "those algorithms don't necessarily have",
  "11:27": "the ability to reflect on what they're",
  "11:29": "observing or to even think critically",
  "11:32": "about what are the limitations of the",
  "11:34": "data that they're fed and that causes",
  "11:37": "all sorts of problems there are these",
  "11:40": "frustrations that emerge when we have",
  "11:41": "these reductive systems that tell us",
  "11:43": "like you should be taking 10,000 steps",
  "11:45": "or what have you I don't even remember",
  "11:47": "what some of these data points are some",
  "11:49": "of them are like how many hours I was",
  "11:51": "standing up or how many steps I took or",
  "11:54": "what my heart rate was or whatever but",
  "11:57": "these are all basically like really",
  "12:00": "crummy measures that sort of approximate",
  "12:02": "in really crummy ways like fitness and",
  "12:05": "like no matter how many of these things",
  "12:07": "that you collect you're never gonna have",
  "12:09": "like a really good sort of holistic view",
  "12:12": "of like how fit or how healthy a person",
  "12:14": "is you're just gonna have a bunch of",
  "12:15": "data points that you can ultimately sort",
  "12:17": "of like draw a boundary around and say",
  "12:18": "like I guess I'm gonna say this is",
  "12:20": "fitness and that's frustrating but it's",
  "12:23": "also really damaging because it it",
  "12:25": "encourages people to try to live",
  "12:27": "according to certain metrics and maybe",
  "12:30": "even optimize for certain ones like",
  "12:32": "right now I'm tricking my watch into",
  "12:33": "thinking I'm exercising and I don't",
  "12:38": "think that that necessarily benefits any",
  "12:40": "of us personally and I do think that it",
  "12:42": "benefits the companies that are",
  "12:43": "collecting these data but I think that",
  "12:46": "like the sort of deeper longer term",
  "12:49": "problem that worries me",
  "12:50": "is that when we talk about things like",
  "12:52": "driving for instance and there are like",
  "12:55": "some reasonably recent papers that have",
  "12:58": "come out just in the last year I think",
  "13:00": "that really what we should be talking",
  "13:01": "about is not the technical stuff the",
  "13:03": "metrics that we're optimizing for but we",
  "13:05": "should be talking about the social",
  "13:06": "problems that precipitated those",
  "13:08": "problems in the first place we should be",
  "13:09": "talking about how we've built cities to",
  "13:11": "be pro cars to the point of being",
  "13:13": "dangerous for pedestrians when we talk",
  "13:15": "about clinical decision making systems",
  "13:18": "then how algorithmic systems are like",
  "13:20": "sort of problematic and",
  "13:21": "people don't necessarily follow the",
  "13:23": "instructions and all that other stuff we",
  "13:24": "should instead talk about the history of",
  "13:27": "Western doctors doing conducting",
  "13:30": "experiments on people of color and",
  "13:32": "establishing a very well earned",
  "13:34": "reputation of being horrible",
  "13:37": "transgressors of human rights and when",
  "13:40": "we talk about things like evaluating",
  "13:42": "bias and algorithmic systems and",
  "13:44": "thinking about sort of like prisons and",
  "13:46": "whatnot we should really think about the",
  "13:48": "carceral state and the social",
  "13:50": "environment that precipitated an entire",
  "13:52": "an entire industry basically of slave",
  "13:55": "labor that continues to this day",
  "13:56": "in prisons that motivates judges and",
  "14:00": "police and legislators to put people in",
  "14:04": "prison for the purpose of extracting",
  "14:07": "labor from them so something that I kind",
  "14:11": "of want to spend a couple of minutes",
  "14:12": "from people just sort of thinking",
  "14:15": "amongst yourselves about is what does",
  "14:17": "the world look like that's built",
  "14:19": "uncritically on historical foundations",
  "14:21": "of greed and exploitation and harm and",
  "14:23": "sort of like how do we perform for",
  "14:25": "algorithmic audiences right now and just",
  "14:28": "to give like some examples I have some",
  "14:29": "sort of kind of jokey prompts that sort",
  "14:34": "of illustrate that people are sort of",
  "14:35": "started to respond to the algorithmic",
  "14:37": "systems themselves and performing I",
  "14:40": "don't asleep for the algorithms benefit",
  "14:42": "but for the algorithms satisfaction",
  "14:44": "certainly and there's sort of like some",
  "14:47": "fun examples so ways to undermine a",
  "14:49": "police state in Hong Kong a lot of",
  "14:51": "people were shining lasers at cameras",
  "14:54": "and whatnot it wasn't super clear",
  "14:55": "whether that was doing anything",
  "14:57": "effectively but the sort of folk wisdom",
  "14:59": "was that the lasers would like mess up",
  "15:01": "the cameras sensors and it would make it",
  "15:03": "difficult for them to identify the",
  "15:05": "people that were protesting in Hong Kong",
  "15:07": "in if you want to get a slightly more",
  "15:10": "personal than that you could wear a",
  "15:11": "shirt that has all these photos of in",
  "15:13": "this case Michael Jackson and it would",
  "15:15": "sort of like frustrate a computer vision",
  "15:18": "system that would try to figure out who",
  "15:19": "you are because it would just see",
  "15:20": "Michael Jackson all over you",
  "15:21": "and if you wanna get even more personal",
  "15:23": "than that you could put makeup on your",
  "15:24": "face which presumably confuses the",
  "15:27": "computer vision systems and makes it",
  "15:29": "difficult for to recognise that one you",
  "15:31": "are a person and that you have a face",
  "15:32": "and to who you are",
  "15:35": "so yeah what I'd like all of you to do",
  "15:37": "is sort of like turn to each other and",
  "15:39": "think about this question and maybe if",
  "15:42": "you run out of things think about what",
  "15:45": "it would look like if a world was built",
  "15:46": "intentionally with the histories that",
  "15:49": "I've talked about in mind so that we",
  "15:51": "could actually intentionally sort of",
  "15:54": "consciously move away from that and what",
  "15:56": "would it look like to build a system or",
  "15:58": "to build a world that that consciously",
  "16:01": "moved away from those from those",
  "16:03": "histories so take I guess two or three",
  "16:05": "minutes and talk amongst yourselves in",
  "16:07": "groups of three or four and we'll come",
  "16:10": "back Wow okay having power is great so",
  "16:18": "yeah does anybody have any thoughts that",
  "16:21": "they'd like to share about I guess",
  "16:22": "either ways that they think about how I",
  "16:26": "guess like we sort of exist in this sort",
  "16:28": "of uncritically built space or potential",
  "16:30": "alternative futures yep yeah sort of I",
  "16:40": "think one example that kind of looked at",
  "16:42": "both so when you look at like gross",
  "16:44": "domestic product GDP you should have",
  "16:46": "have to have an inherent bias against",
  "16:48": "all the existing metrics because sort of",
  "16:50": "they were to be measured it takes active",
  "16:53": "work which means that there must be an",
  "16:54": "entrenched house for protecting the act",
  "16:56": "of measurement and though I found us",
  "16:59": "something to intention of those",
  "17:01": "histories only appears an economist with",
  "17:03": "the Santa Fe Institute",
  "17:04": "proposed the domestic product which is",
  "17:07": "saying it's not looking at the average",
  "17:08": "of every dollar over time look at every",
  "17:10": "person an average every person together",
  "17:12": "so if even one person goes to zero",
  "17:14": "income the whole thing is going to go go",
  "17:17": "down and sort of like sort of the area",
  "17:19": "distant you know ensemble not the",
  "17:22": "ensemble average with the time series",
  "17:23": "average for each person and so I think",
  "17:25": "that in general trying to think of how",
  "17:27": "do I humanize a metric more is the way",
  "17:29": "to build intentionally and I think that",
  "17:32": "when you look at an existing measure",
  "17:34": "give again from using it why who's",
  "17:36": "allowing them to continue measuring it",
  "17:38": "yeah that's a really great point",
  "17:40": "I guess if anybody has any other",
  "17:41": "thoughts I can like vamp for a few",
  "17:43": "seconds",
  "17:45": "okay well feel free to raise your hand",
  "17:47": "while I talk for a minute yeah that's a",
  "17:49": "really great point there's a book called",
  "17:52": "measuring what counts",
  "17:53": "which sort of talks about a lot of this",
  "17:55": "stuff and they're like former White",
  "17:56": "House economists who were basically",
  "17:59": "talking about like how we had all these",
  "18:01": "great metrics for the economy and they",
  "18:03": "weren't accurately reflecting like the",
  "18:05": "reality like the lived experience of a",
  "18:07": "lot of the people that were that were",
  "18:08": "not experiencing like super great stock",
  "18:12": "market is it like sort of like",
  "18:14": "performance and whatnot any other yeah",
  "18:24": "[Music]",
  "18:38": "how many languages are there in the",
  "18:42": "Philippines there's about 7,000 I lived",
  "18:45": "in 700 languages and so that Facebook",
  "18:48": "permanents the way that they measure how",
  "18:50": "they take cases like whether if you need",
  "18:51": "more something else the metric scale but",
  "18:55": "if you look at generally",
  "18:56": "underrepresented using any say the word",
  "18:59": "underrepresented versus minority like",
  "19:01": "California has majority quote-unquote",
  "19:03": "Latinos but they are underrepresented",
  "19:06": "Asian Americans are very",
  "19:08": "underrepresented in number but then you",
  "19:11": "compare like in Asia it just like the",
  "19:15": "way that these terms that they're so in",
  "19:18": "historical and how we're measuring",
  "19:19": "things itself what would it look like if",
  "19:22": "you were to take that into account as",
  "19:24": "very complex I think by country and by",
  "19:28": "history of colonialism that it makes it",
  "19:31": "so difficult to measure it but I think",
  "19:35": "the hardest part would I hi - scale and",
  "19:37": "if you visited the Philippine Consulate",
  "19:40": "trying to describe to entrepreneurs who",
  "19:43": "were tech versus small business and I",
  "19:45": "said well most of these investors the",
  "19:48": "way they evaluate things is does this",
  "19:50": "scale and like that is a very",
  "19:51": "capitalistic notion that I was framing",
  "19:53": "as much as like I hate that like the",
  "19:57": "for tech so it's really hard to just",
  "20:00": "figure out like what would make this a",
  "20:02": "much more humane environment for",
  "20:04": "technology okay great well if you have",
  "20:08": "any more thoughts I'd love to hear it in",
  "20:10": "the forum and stuff so feel free to",
  "20:12": "chime in there Thanks",
  "20:14": "[Music]",
  "20:15": "[Applause]"
