0:00:00.000,0:00:10.349
Oh Thank You Lee that was fantastic and

0:00:03.600,0:00:15.500
that's also a good good lead-in I was

0:00:10.349,0:00:18.359
going to talk about our ecosystem and I

0:00:15.500,0:00:20.550
think I'm gonna skip ahead to my section

0:00:18.359,0:00:23.880
on metrics just because that seems like

0:00:20.550,0:00:28.710
such a kind of natural direction to go

0:00:23.880,0:00:32.700
in from here and so I'll cover the other

0:00:28.710,0:00:35.430
material next week since we definitely

0:00:32.700,0:00:38.969
won't be finishing but so this is this

0:00:35.430,0:00:41.940
has come up previously in class this

0:00:38.969,0:00:43.950
idea of good hearts law that we met when

0:00:41.940,0:00:45.559
a measure becomes a target it ceases to

0:00:43.950,0:00:47.760
be a good measure

0:00:45.559,0:00:50.539
another framing and we're about to see

0:00:47.760,0:00:53.190
several examples of what this means now

0:00:50.539,0:00:55.020
their framing of it is Campbell's law

0:00:53.190,0:00:57.270
which is the more any quantitative

0:00:55.020,0:00:59.699
social indicator is used for social

0:00:57.270,0:01:01.620
decision making the more subject it will

0:00:59.699,0:01:03.090
be to corruption pressures and the more

0:01:01.620,0:01:05.700
apt it will be to distort and corrupt

0:01:03.090,0:01:08.549
the social processes it is intended to

0:01:05.700,0:01:10.619
monitor and so this is a little bit kind

0:01:08.549,0:01:15.119
of more specific than good hearts law it

0:01:10.619,0:01:18.090
covers some of the same cases and this

0:01:15.119,0:01:19.979
is a topic that I wrote a blog post

0:01:18.090,0:01:22.590
about last year and then ended up kind

0:01:19.979,0:01:24.270
of extending it into a paper if you want

0:01:22.590,0:01:25.560
want to hear more about this but this is

0:01:24.270,0:01:28.650
something that I think is a really kind

0:01:25.560,0:01:30.600
of fundamental challenge for AI but

0:01:28.650,0:01:35.100
optimizing metrics can lead to

0:01:30.600,0:01:37.439
manipulation gaming myopic focus on

0:01:35.100,0:01:40.829
short-term goals unexpected negative

0:01:37.439,0:01:43.619
consequences and unfortunately much of

0:01:40.829,0:01:45.960
AI machine learning focuses on

0:01:43.619,0:01:48.750
optimizing a metric because that's kind

0:01:45.960,0:01:49.770
of what what most techniques are doing

0:01:48.750,0:01:52.980
and that's something that we've gotten

0:01:49.770,0:01:54.390
very very good at is optimizing a metric

0:01:52.980,0:01:57.090
[Music]

0:01:54.390,0:02:00.390
so one example that we saw back in week

0:01:57.090,0:02:02.220
two of something that can go wrong is

0:02:00.390,0:02:04.979
measurement bias and so we talked about

0:02:02.220,0:02:07.160
a paper then where the researchers

0:02:04.979,0:02:09.899
wanted to predict who's most likely to

0:02:07.160,0:02:13.260
have a stroke and this could be used to

0:02:09.899,0:02:17.450
prior prioritize patients at the the ER

0:02:13.260,0:02:20.100
and they found some really surprising

0:02:17.450,0:02:22.310
predictive risk factors such as

0:02:20.100,0:02:25.560
accidental injury benign breast lump

0:02:22.310,0:02:27.270
colonoscopy and sinusitis and it turns

0:02:25.560,0:02:29.670
out that what they were picking out was

0:02:27.270,0:02:31.739
just who utilizes healthcare versus who

0:02:29.670,0:02:33.269
doesn't and they're kind of people that

0:02:31.739,0:02:35.930
have high utilization of health care

0:02:33.269,0:02:38.310
others that have low utilization and

0:02:35.930,0:02:41.430
this is a case where we don't actually

0:02:38.310,0:02:43.769
have data of stroke which is a region of

0:02:41.430,0:02:46.980
the brain being denied oxygen from new

0:02:43.769,0:02:49.440
blood flow the data we have this a proxy

0:02:46.980,0:02:51.269
it's who had symptoms went to the doctor

0:02:49.440,0:02:53.820
received the right test got the right

0:02:51.269,0:02:56.940
diagnosis and there are all sorts of

0:02:53.820,0:02:58.980
factors that can influence that I have

0:02:56.940,0:03:00.690
you know including who has access to

0:02:58.980,0:03:03.030
healthcare who can afford their copay

0:03:00.690,0:03:05.730
what sort of racial or gender biases

0:03:03.030,0:03:07.739
might the doctors have cultural

0:03:05.730,0:03:09.390
influences so a lot of a lot of

0:03:07.739,0:03:13.290
different things so this is this is one

0:03:09.390,0:03:16.140
way that metrics can fail another a

0:03:13.290,0:03:20.070
really interesting paper from the 2000s

0:03:16.140,0:03:22.440
looking at the UK's health care system

0:03:20.070,0:03:25.459
where they move to trying to have kind

0:03:22.440,0:03:28.350
of more metrics and then they found that

0:03:25.459,0:03:31.650
it's depressing they introduced new

0:03:28.350,0:03:33.900
targets around ER wait times and this

0:03:31.650,0:03:35.989
led to people cancelling scheduled

0:03:33.900,0:03:38.070
operations the hospitals would cancel

0:03:35.989,0:03:40.260
operations so that they could draft more

0:03:38.070,0:03:43.310
people into the ER to keep the ER wait

0:03:40.260,0:03:46.170
time down if it was getting too high

0:03:43.310,0:03:48.329
requiring patients to wait in lines of

0:03:46.170,0:03:50.040
ambulances outside the hospital because

0:03:48.329,0:03:52.350
that didn't count as part of their

0:03:50.040,0:03:56.880
weight in the ER if they were in a and

0:03:52.350,0:03:58.680
an ambulance outside the ER they turned

0:03:56.880,0:04:00.299
stretchers into beds by putting them in

0:03:58.680,0:04:03.000
hallways because then they could say the

0:04:00.299,0:04:06.060
person is no longer waiting there in a

0:04:03.000,0:04:08.100
quote bed and they also found a big

0:04:06.060,0:04:10.260
discrepancy in numbers reported by

0:04:08.100,0:04:12.270
fools versus by patience so if they

0:04:10.260,0:04:13.800
surveyed hospitals on how long people

0:04:12.270,0:04:16.260
were waiting they're getting different

0:04:13.800,0:04:21.600
results than if they survey patients on

0:04:16.260,0:04:23.820
how long did you wait and so this and

0:04:21.600,0:04:26.640
this is just kind of one of many

0:04:23.820,0:04:28.650
examples this report gives of how there

0:04:26.640,0:04:31.230
are unexpected kind of negative

0:04:28.650,0:04:36.000
consequences of this push to emphasize

0:04:31.230,0:04:37.350
numbers more and this is a mix of well I

0:04:36.000,0:04:39.420
guess I say this is a lot of kind of

0:04:37.350,0:04:41.460
gaming I mean some of the ones about the

0:04:39.420,0:04:43.020
the discrepancies in numbers some of

0:04:41.460,0:04:46.140
that can be I think

0:04:43.020,0:04:47.880
unintentional but people kind of knowing

0:04:46.140,0:04:51.320
what they need leads them to kind of

0:04:47.880,0:04:53.640
give answers that will line up with that

0:04:51.320,0:04:56.160
another example we've seen in the United

0:04:53.640,0:04:57.810
States of kind of manipulation in gaming

0:04:56.160,0:05:00.060
is that as more and more emphasis has

0:04:57.810,0:05:02.910
been put on standardized testing there

0:05:00.060,0:05:05.010
have been kind of widespread scandals of

0:05:02.910,0:05:07.170
school districts cheating so this is

0:05:05.010,0:05:10.530
where teachers or school administrators

0:05:07.170,0:05:13.530
are altering their students score our

0:05:10.530,0:05:15.600
answers to get higher scores and this

0:05:13.530,0:05:17.700
has happened in a number of states now

0:05:15.600,0:05:22.140
that kind of testing is so high-stakes

0:05:17.700,0:05:23.240
and I didn't include this and I don't

0:05:22.140,0:05:26.460
think I talked about this previously

0:05:23.240,0:05:28.320
there was a case that Cathy O'Neil

0:05:26.460,0:05:30.150
covers in her book weapons of mass

0:05:28.320,0:05:32.430
destruction and had been covered in the

0:05:30.150,0:05:37.760
I believe the Washington Post of a

0:05:32.430,0:05:42.930
teacher in either Virginia or DC that

0:05:37.760,0:05:44.580
was fired by an algorithm and her the

0:05:42.930,0:05:46.350
principal of her school loved her the

0:05:44.580,0:05:48.570
parents of her students really loved her

0:05:46.350,0:05:51.450
and she couldn't get a conclusive answer

0:05:48.570,0:05:54.540
of why she was fired but her suspicion

0:05:51.450,0:05:57.660
was that her students scores seemed

0:05:54.540,0:05:59.340
artificially high when the previous year

0:05:57.660,0:06:01.530
and they had kind of been at a different

0:05:59.340,0:06:03.960
school and then her students scores

0:06:01.530,0:06:06.870
dropped a kind of more normal levels

0:06:03.960,0:06:07.830
after her teaching and her teaching was

0:06:06.870,0:06:10.620
being evaluated

0:06:07.830,0:06:12.630
it's believed one of the factors is how

0:06:10.620,0:06:15.090
the students scores changed while they

0:06:12.630,0:06:17.010
were in her class and so there I feel

0:06:15.090,0:06:19.470
like it's kind of an intersection of two

0:06:17.010,0:06:21.810
negative trends you have the teachers

0:06:19.470,0:06:23.370
who most likely at the

0:06:21.810,0:06:25.770
previous school may have cheated because

0:06:23.370,0:06:27.690
they felt pressured to do so then when

0:06:25.770,0:06:29.250
she didn't then you have this other

0:06:27.690,0:06:32.580
algorithmic system that's firing

0:06:29.250,0:06:35.460
teachers based on these metrics and she

0:06:32.580,0:06:39.980
kind of ends up fired because of it so

0:06:35.460,0:06:43.230
that's kind of sobering sobering example

0:06:39.980,0:06:46.020
there was also an article on essay

0:06:43.230,0:06:47.700
grading software so there's this

0:06:46.020,0:06:49.950
software that grades essays is being

0:06:47.700,0:06:55.410
used and I think at least 22 states now

0:06:49.950,0:06:57.270
I was found that so the software focuses

0:06:55.410,0:06:58.830
on what you can measure right and we

0:06:57.270,0:07:00.780
can't measure everything that you can

0:06:58.830,0:07:04.440
measure sentence length and vocabulary

0:07:00.780,0:07:06.990
spelling subject verb agreement however

0:07:04.440,0:07:09.600
you can't measure creativity or novelty

0:07:06.990,0:07:11.340
or some more kind of abstract qualities

0:07:09.600,0:07:14.729
that can still be very important in

0:07:11.340,0:07:17.450
writing and so there was a computer

0:07:14.729,0:07:20.070
program that someone created that made

0:07:17.450,0:07:22.200
gibberish essays with sophisticated

0:07:20.070,0:07:26.930
words and sophisticated phrasing and

0:07:22.200,0:07:28.890
that got good scores it found the

0:07:26.930,0:07:30.840
research found that essays by

0:07:28.890,0:07:33.210
african-american students received lower

0:07:30.840,0:07:37.110
grades from the computer than from human

0:07:33.210,0:07:39.419
graders and essays by students from

0:07:37.110,0:07:41.490
mainland China received higher scores

0:07:39.419,0:07:44.669
from the computer than from expert human

0:07:41.490,0:07:47.190
graders which caused the researchers to

0:07:44.669,0:07:49.530
suspect that they may be using chunks of

0:07:47.190,0:07:51.270
pre memorized text so this is kind of

0:07:49.530,0:07:54.690
now we're combining what we learned

0:07:51.270,0:07:57.780
about with bias with a kind of this

0:07:54.690,0:07:59.400
example of overemphasizing metrics and

0:07:57.780,0:08:01.919
for me this kind of really strikes me

0:07:59.400,0:08:03.419
and that I I think of writing is

0:08:01.919,0:08:07.830
something that has a very intrinsically

0:08:03.419,0:08:10.860
human quality and that it's usually

0:08:07.830,0:08:13.020
humans communicating with humans but

0:08:10.860,0:08:15.360
here you know to have an example where a

0:08:13.020,0:08:17.190
computer program can generate a

0:08:15.360,0:08:19.229
gibberish essay that then will be

0:08:17.190,0:08:21.360
evaluated by another computer program

0:08:19.229,0:08:27.020
and receive you know receive a high

0:08:21.360,0:08:30.360
score but this also to me illustrates

0:08:27.020,0:08:32.039
some of the quad qualities that we can't

0:08:30.360,0:08:34.080
quantify and that we can't measure that

0:08:32.039,0:08:36.919
those tend to then not kind of be valued

0:08:34.080,0:08:36.919
if they can't be measured

0:08:37.610,0:08:45.300
this is an article just from the last

0:08:39.899,0:08:49.500
week about tik-tok marketing and so the

0:08:45.300,0:08:52.709
image is from Chipotle's hashtag burrito

0:08:49.500,0:08:55.140
campaign which was where you got a Half

0:08:52.709,0:08:58.740
Price burrito if you were a costume on

0:08:55.140,0:09:00.510
Halloween and tik-tok said hey this had

0:08:58.740,0:09:03.570
three point nine billion views that

0:09:00.510,0:09:04.560
sounds amazing that's a ton of use and

0:09:03.570,0:09:07.170
contrast

0:09:04.560,0:09:09.269
tik-tok has only been downloaded 145

0:09:07.170,0:09:12.440
million times in the USA this was a US

0:09:09.269,0:09:17.430
campaign so what what does this mean for

0:09:12.440,0:09:20.310
these numbers and tik-tok won't say kind

0:09:17.430,0:09:22.380
of how it classifies views but you have

0:09:20.310,0:09:24.149
a lot of a lot of companies put a lot of

0:09:22.380,0:09:26.579
importance on these metrics and it's

0:09:24.149,0:09:28.950
often kind of not clear how they're

0:09:26.579,0:09:32.399
gathered or even kind of what sense they

0:09:28.950,0:09:35.300
make in terms of impact or even how many

0:09:32.399,0:09:38.670
people actually saw saw this campaign

0:09:35.300,0:09:43.170
and so then people said that it reminded

0:09:38.670,0:09:47.060
them of when Facebook pivoted to video

0:09:43.170,0:09:49.680
several years but years ago Facebook

0:09:47.060,0:09:52.079
exaggerated video watch time by as much

0:09:49.680,0:09:54.750
as nine hundred percent was alleged by

0:09:52.079,0:09:57.329
one lawsuit so what happened was

0:09:54.750,0:09:59.339
Facebook said we know we're switching to

0:09:57.329,0:10:01.410
video and had these really positive

0:09:59.339,0:10:03.980
numbers of how much video was being

0:10:01.410,0:10:07.020
watched and so many news organizations

0:10:03.980,0:10:08.310
laid off journalists in response and

0:10:07.020,0:10:11.760
said oh you know we want to focus more

0:10:08.310,0:10:13.740
on our digital are on our video arms and

0:10:11.760,0:10:16.560
then it turns out that the numbers for

0:10:13.740,0:10:19.410
video were inflated and misleading there

0:10:16.560,0:10:22.140
was also kind of an air and and this is

0:10:19.410,0:10:25.160
something that there was a lawsuit about

0:10:22.140,0:10:27.540
that Facebook settled for 40 million

0:10:25.160,0:10:29.490
although that is just that was just

0:10:27.540,0:10:34.019
advertisers bringing suit so this

0:10:29.490,0:10:35.790
doesn't even impact all the kind of news

0:10:34.019,0:10:37.709
agencies and journalists that were

0:10:35.790,0:10:39.839
impacted because many of these

0:10:37.709,0:10:41.190
organizations laid off written

0:10:39.839,0:10:43.260
journalists because they wanted to put

0:10:41.190,0:10:45.329
more resources into video and then when

0:10:43.260,0:10:47.339
video turned out to not be as effective

0:10:45.329,0:10:48.870
than they laid off the video people they

0:10:47.339,0:10:52.860
had hired

0:10:48.870,0:10:54.630
it was kind of two rounds of layoffs but

0:10:52.860,0:10:57.690
capture is kind of how how much metrics

0:10:54.630,0:11:04.529
can drive kind of drive behavior of

0:10:57.690,0:11:07.529
organizations so there is an interesting

0:11:04.529,0:11:10.050
paper on the different failure modes of

0:11:07.529,0:11:14.850
good hearts law kind of breaking them

0:11:10.050,0:11:16.740
out into four categories so one is when

0:11:14.850,0:11:18.930
the difference between the proxy and the

0:11:16.740,0:11:21.029
goal is important and I think in almost

0:11:18.930,0:11:22.740
all cases we don't actually have the

0:11:21.029,0:11:25.110
data that we truly want what we have is

0:11:22.740,0:11:28.589
a proxy and sometimes that proxy is

0:11:25.110,0:11:30.660
closer than others but in cases where

0:11:28.589,0:11:32.970
the difference is significant that has

0:11:30.660,0:11:35.100
an impact and so that's what we saw was

0:11:32.970,0:11:38.670
kind of the health data about who had a

0:11:35.100,0:11:40.140
stroke there's extremel good heart where

0:11:38.670,0:11:42.029
the relationship between the proxy and

0:11:40.140,0:11:44.880
the goal is different when taken to an

0:11:42.029,0:11:47.100
extreme and so sometimes a kind of

0:11:44.880,0:11:49.980
relationship makes sense but once you

0:11:47.100,0:11:53.190
emphasize it that sends you kind of more

0:11:49.980,0:11:56.640
to an extreme where it's less where's

0:11:53.190,0:11:58.740
just a different relationship there can

0:11:56.640,0:12:01.290
be a non causal relationship between the

0:11:58.740,0:12:04.850
proxy and the goal and intervening on

0:12:01.290,0:12:07.800
one may fail to impact the other and

0:12:04.850,0:12:10.560
then there's also advert err adversaries

0:12:07.800,0:12:11.880
attempting to game your chosen proxy as

0:12:10.560,0:12:13.830
I thought this is kind of interesting as

0:12:11.880,0:12:21.060
a breakout of different different ways

0:12:13.830,0:12:24.000
that this can go wrong and we've talked

0:12:21.060,0:12:26.850
previously about YouTube's recommended

0:12:24.000,0:12:30.779
recommendation system Guillaume truss a

0:12:26.850,0:12:34.070
lot has a great post about this former a

0:12:30.779,0:12:37.920
kind of AI engineer at Google /youtube

0:12:34.070,0:12:41.040
and he quotes a YouTube blog post from

0:12:37.920,0:12:44.190
several years ago in which Google

0:12:41.040,0:12:45.990
Google's YouTube said if viewers are

0:12:44.190,0:12:47.430
watching more YouTube it signals to us

0:12:45.990,0:12:49.860
that they're happier with the content

0:12:47.430,0:12:51.600
they found it means that creators are

0:12:49.860,0:12:53.490
attracting more engaged audience it

0:12:51.600,0:12:56.279
opens up more opportunities to generate

0:12:53.490,0:12:57.780
revenue for our partners and so here

0:12:56.279,0:13:01.430
they're kind of boiling down that watch

0:12:57.780,0:13:02.970
time is about happiness and revenue

0:13:01.430,0:13:05.459
however I think we can

0:13:02.970,0:13:08.189
I'll think of times that we spend online

0:13:05.459,0:13:09.959
where we're not exactly happy and not

0:13:08.189,0:13:12.540
proud of how we've used our time

0:13:09.959,0:13:17.730
afterwards and I think this is kind of a

0:13:12.540,0:13:19.430
very very rough proxy and Guillaume does

0:13:17.730,0:13:22.470
a good job of kind of explaining how

0:13:19.430,0:13:24.899
also this ends up incentivizing content

0:13:22.470,0:13:26.819
that says that other platforms are lying

0:13:24.899,0:13:29.420
to you because you should spend more

0:13:26.819,0:13:37.139
time on the content from that platform

0:13:29.420,0:13:42.389
in order to maximize the watch time are

0:13:37.139,0:13:49.019
there questions so far on metrics Aaron

0:13:42.389,0:13:51.660
came past the catch box I had a question

0:13:49.019,0:13:59.519
about tick tock and we had opinions

0:13:51.660,0:14:02.879
about it and really China small comment

0:13:59.519,0:14:12.750
I love absolutely love Gary Vaynerchuk

0:14:02.879,0:14:14.730
because users don't think about the

0:14:12.750,0:14:17.550
number but it's it's so hard because

0:14:14.730,0:14:20.819
he's basically don't be a slave to the

0:14:17.550,0:14:22.199
algorithm but in fact Li like a walking

0:14:20.819,0:14:29.910
contradiction you're you're still making

0:14:22.199,0:14:32.879
money from like the the you know it's

0:14:29.910,0:14:35.220
like a two-sided like the thing that I

0:14:32.879,0:14:38.699
hear he's promoting take away I don't

0:14:35.220,0:14:40.110
know if yeah I'll table tick-tock that's

0:14:38.699,0:14:41.730
something we can discuss on the forums

0:14:40.110,0:14:46.230
and I don't feel like I've been it kind

0:14:41.730,0:14:48.509
of informed enough opinion on it yeah

0:14:46.230,0:14:50.910
and this issue of you know I Instagram

0:14:48.509,0:14:52.649
removing likes in certain countries I

0:14:50.910,0:14:56.129
mean there are there's still kind of

0:14:52.649,0:14:58.199
this asymmetry where Instagram is still

0:14:56.129,0:15:00.809
using that data on its side to promote

0:14:58.199,0:15:04.079
things and so then it's impacting people

0:15:00.809,0:15:06.000
in an opaque way although you also kind

0:15:04.079,0:15:08.550
of see the impact but I can definitely

0:15:06.000,0:15:11.220
recognize and myself how it influences

0:15:08.550,0:15:14.639
what I post on various networks kind of

0:15:11.220,0:15:17.240
seeing what gets shared and what people

0:15:14.639,0:15:17.240
respond to

0:15:17.920,0:15:21.740
yeah and that it actually that's

0:15:19.850,0:15:23.720
probably good example of what Ali was

0:15:21.740,0:15:25.190
mentioning of how people perform for

0:15:23.720,0:15:26.720
algorithms I definitely think there's a

0:15:25.190,0:15:28.880
sense and kind of in which people you

0:15:26.720,0:15:31.459
know can tailor tailor their content

0:15:28.880,0:15:32.810
based on what they think the algorithm

0:15:31.459,0:15:35.240
is going to reward what they think will

0:15:32.810,0:15:36.680
get kind of likes or views and I and I

0:15:35.240,0:15:39.860
think that can be very kind of insidious

0:15:36.680,0:15:41.180
like it's not necessarily alike no I'm

0:15:39.860,0:15:43.010
explicitly doing this just for the

0:15:41.180,0:15:52.579
algorithm but I think it does kind of

0:15:43.010,0:15:54.740
influence many of us another factor is

0:15:52.579,0:15:58.700
that our online environments I think are

0:15:54.740,0:16:00.529
designed to be very addictive the

0:15:58.700,0:16:02.600
incentives focus on short term metrics

0:16:00.529,0:16:04.579
and the fundamental business models

0:16:02.600,0:16:06.019
around manipulating people's behavior

0:16:04.579,0:16:08.120
and monopolizing their time and I think

0:16:06.019,0:16:11.839
you know kind of what we click like on

0:16:08.120,0:16:14.120
or what we retweet or share is often

0:16:11.839,0:16:15.860
used as this proxy of what we like but

0:16:14.120,0:16:18.769
it's you know it's what we like in a

0:16:15.860,0:16:21.140
very constrained and designed in a

0:16:18.769,0:16:23.480
specific way environment I don't know

0:16:21.140,0:16:24.940
that it's necessarily or in fact I don't

0:16:23.480,0:16:28.579
think it's getting it kind of like our

0:16:24.940,0:16:31.160
purist likes and you know I always think

0:16:28.579,0:16:33.050
I've kind of the example of reading a

0:16:31.160,0:16:35.329
long form journalism article that

0:16:33.050,0:16:37.970
potentially you know is harder to read

0:16:35.329,0:16:40.370
but months of research went into that

0:16:37.970,0:16:42.740
I'm gonna it's gonna help shape my

0:16:40.370,0:16:44.300
thinking on a topic and I may be glad

0:16:42.740,0:16:46.550
you know in the future that I read it

0:16:44.300,0:16:49.399
versus kind of the short-term impulse of

0:16:46.550,0:16:51.560
do I want to read something more catchy

0:16:49.399,0:16:53.720
and kind of easier to read in the moment

0:16:51.560,0:16:55.279
and I think we've gone through this with

0:16:53.720,0:16:58.550
the food industry and are a little bit

0:16:55.279,0:17:00.860
further along of a lot of junk food is

0:16:58.550,0:17:01.760
really appealing in the short term if

0:17:00.860,0:17:03.860
you don't think on a long term

0:17:01.760,0:17:05.900
perspective and then also depending on

0:17:03.860,0:17:08.410
how your environments designed as a

0:17:05.900,0:17:10.550
depth effect she uses the example of

0:17:08.410,0:17:12.919
cafeteria that's kind of actively

0:17:10.550,0:17:14.510
shoving junk food in our faces we're not

0:17:12.919,0:17:17.750
even having to reach for it it's kind of

0:17:14.510,0:17:19.939
being brought to us and so whenever we

0:17:17.750,0:17:21.559
think about kind of using metrics about

0:17:19.939,0:17:23.900
what people prefer to remember that

0:17:21.559,0:17:27.400
we're in this kind of very constrained

0:17:23.900,0:17:40.480
and short-term focused environment

0:17:27.400,0:17:45.220
and in the back corner had any thoughts

0:17:40.480,0:17:50.080
on the iPhone like stream time like how

0:17:45.220,0:17:56.590
weak now it's your phone and what the

0:17:50.080,0:17:59.310
relationship is to your previous the

0:17:56.590,0:18:03.970
idea of like where that idea came from

0:17:59.310,0:18:05.500
being receive that's a good yes I'm not

0:18:03.970,0:18:12.300
them following that closely I know that

0:18:05.500,0:18:15.700
I will say like the Tristan Harris's

0:18:12.300,0:18:17.680
time well-spent and totally blanking on

0:18:15.700,0:18:20.050
the name of Center for Humane technology

0:18:17.680,0:18:22.600
has promoted a lot of those kind of

0:18:20.050,0:18:25.200
design fixes of kind of what can we

0:18:22.600,0:18:27.610
change about design to to help people

0:18:25.200,0:18:30.730
and so that includes things of yeah like

0:18:27.610,0:18:32.650
tracking how long you're spending or

0:18:30.730,0:18:34.300
sending a reminder like hey you've been

0:18:32.650,0:18:35.670
on Twitter for a half hours it's how you

0:18:34.300,0:18:39.370
want to spend your time right now

0:18:35.670,0:18:41.200
another one I know is using black and

0:18:39.370,0:18:43.930
white screen which was already an

0:18:41.200,0:18:46.410
accessibility feature but using that to

0:18:43.930,0:18:50.860
kind of make your attack less

0:18:46.410,0:18:52.830
stimulating or appealing I think um I

0:18:50.860,0:18:55.420
think there's value to those efforts I

0:18:52.830,0:18:57.490
don't think I don't think they get at

0:18:55.420,0:19:00.490
the fundamental business model and so if

0:18:57.490,0:19:02.440
the you know the business model is still

0:19:00.490,0:19:05.800
around advertising and kind of time

0:19:02.440,0:19:07.390
spent that there's I don't think that's

0:19:05.800,0:19:09.370
fully gonna solve the problem but I do

0:19:07.390,0:19:11.560
think that there is some benefit to yeah

0:19:09.370,0:19:12.880
kind of thinking about that design but

0:19:11.560,0:19:15.250
it's important to kind of connect that

0:19:12.880,0:19:17.820
the you know the design didn't come out

0:19:15.250,0:19:19.960
of nowhere it's very much tied to the

0:19:17.820,0:19:22.720
business model and a Fender lying

0:19:19.960,0:19:25.330
business model doesn't change I don't

0:19:22.720,0:19:28.890
know how much I think they're limits to

0:19:25.330,0:19:28.890
kind of what design changes can do

0:19:29.950,0:19:35.980
oh and then okay we're at eight o'clock

0:19:33.029,0:19:38.889
so we'll we'll put back up here and

0:19:35.980,0:19:40.389
finish our ecosystem next time so also

0:19:38.889,0:19:43.269
we'll kind of talk about what are some

0:19:40.389,0:19:47.529
of the the forces that are kind of

0:19:43.269,0:19:50.500
acting on entrepreneurs and companies

0:19:47.529,0:19:52.360
and tack to kind of understand kind of

0:19:50.500,0:19:54.549
these broader systems that influence us

0:19:52.360,0:19:57.419
but I will see you back next week for

0:19:54.549,0:19:57.419
our last class
