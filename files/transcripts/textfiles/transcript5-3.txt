0:00:00.000,0:00:07.230
I mean I hate everyone welcome back and

0:00:04.589,0:00:09.929
so now we're gonna have a special mini

0:00:07.230,0:00:13.320
guest lecture by Olli al-khatib who is

0:00:09.929,0:00:15.109
our data ethics fellow he was also the

0:00:13.320,0:00:18.660
author of one of the assigned readings

0:00:15.109,0:00:20.220
for this week and so losing of a

0:00:18.660,0:00:21.480
presentation and then I have a kind of

0:00:20.220,0:00:23.369
week five person tation that I will

0:00:21.480,0:00:25.140
start after that and this will probably

0:00:23.369,0:00:26.849
go into next week some kind of my

0:00:25.140,0:00:30.740
presentation which is fine clearly we

0:00:26.849,0:00:30.740
have extra time there but here's Ali

0:00:33.020,0:00:36.030
[Applause]

0:00:34.280,0:00:40.110
thanks everyone

0:00:36.030,0:00:43.280
save it until after Hey

0:00:40.110,0:00:45.570
so I want to talk a little bit about

0:00:43.280,0:00:47.670
some thoughts that have been sort of

0:00:45.570,0:00:49.800
knocking around in my head lately and it

0:00:47.670,0:00:52.910
sort of starts with this book seeing

0:00:49.800,0:00:56.280
like a state by a guy named James Scott

0:00:52.910,0:00:57.960
in the book seeing like a state Scott

0:00:56.280,0:00:59.609
makes this argument that governments

0:00:57.960,0:01:01.890
basically make sense of the world by

0:00:59.609,0:01:03.359
operationalizing it in certain ways to

0:01:01.890,0:01:05.159
allow them to make comparisons and

0:01:03.359,0:01:07.500
decisions and they do this in ways that

0:01:05.159,0:01:10.140
are pretty intuitive are familiar to us

0:01:07.500,0:01:12.680
like they standardized how we make sense

0:01:10.140,0:01:15.330
the family names how they how we

0:01:12.680,0:01:19.020
instantiate sort of measures so that we

0:01:15.330,0:01:20.630
can exchange and trade how to do surveys

0:01:19.020,0:01:24.299
and censuses which is a topic of

0:01:20.630,0:01:26.640
controversy this year in particular how

0:01:24.299,0:01:29.460
we organize our transportation like

0:01:26.640,0:01:32.130
where stops are Wed and stops are just

0:01:29.460,0:01:34.110
so that we can get around and a lot of

0:01:32.130,0:01:36.750
this is to make the world which is a

0:01:34.110,0:01:39.810
really messy place legible to a state

0:01:36.750,0:01:42.060
which is which sort of thrives on order

0:01:39.810,0:01:45.479
and being able to make sense of things

0:01:42.060,0:01:48.780
in a clear and coherent way but they

0:01:45.479,0:01:50.280
also scaffold power and this is sort of

0:01:48.780,0:01:51.750
clear in a lot of different ways but

0:01:50.280,0:01:53.159
like one of the ways that was really

0:01:51.750,0:01:56.520
salient to me when I was reading this

0:01:53.159,0:01:59.250
book was that there's this idea of like

0:01:56.520,0:02:01.049
what's your domain like California is

0:01:59.250,0:02:03.240
one domain that has the governance and

0:02:01.049,0:02:06.180
all this other stuff but it also says

0:02:03.240,0:02:08.069
what's not part of the domain and just

0:02:06.180,0:02:09.569
in doing that just in sayings for

0:02:08.069,0:02:11.819
instance where the boundary is which is

0:02:09.569,0:02:13.860
this really fuzzy difficult to sort of

0:02:11.819,0:02:16.470
articulate thing in the real world

0:02:13.860,0:02:18.450
it implicitly also starts to build up

0:02:16.470,0:02:20.250
what are the powers of a state beyond

0:02:18.450,0:02:22.230
sort of establishing its boundaries and

0:02:20.250,0:02:25.710
all of these other things there are lots

0:02:22.230,0:02:27.120
of other ways that sort of regimented

0:02:25.710,0:02:30.380
the ways that we make sense of the world

0:02:27.120,0:02:32.850
help scaffold power for for governments

0:02:30.380,0:02:35.460
but I think the underlying point here is

0:02:32.850,0:02:37.170
that we in general people make sense of

0:02:35.460,0:02:38.460
the world and make sense of the world

0:02:37.170,0:02:40.500
and interpret the world in really

0:02:38.460,0:02:42.330
constrained ways and we do it because

0:02:40.500,0:02:45.600
it's how we cope with way too much

0:02:42.330,0:02:48.750
information and this was really salient

0:02:45.600,0:02:50.400
again to me in the book because one of

0:02:48.750,0:02:52.230
the stories that he talks about is that

0:02:50.400,0:02:53.700
during the Industrial Revolution there

0:02:52.230,0:02:55.980
were all these forests this is actually

0:02:53.700,0:02:58.950
a screenshot of like I think Lake Tahoe

0:02:55.980,0:03:00.360
so not what he was talking about but in

0:02:58.950,0:03:02.130
the Industrial Revolution Europeans

0:03:00.360,0:03:04.140
wanted to make sense of how many trees

0:03:02.130,0:03:05.940
there were in the forest so they could

0:03:04.140,0:03:08.340
harvest trees and not totally destroy

0:03:05.940,0:03:10.260
their forest the forest sort of ecology

0:03:08.340,0:03:11.910
and what they realized was that they

0:03:10.260,0:03:13.800
could count a little subset of the trees

0:03:11.910,0:03:15.030
and they would be able to sort of

0:03:13.800,0:03:16.320
extrapolate from there a lot of this

0:03:15.030,0:03:18.060
stuff if you've taken introductory

0:03:16.320,0:03:19.680
statistics is the sort of stuff that

0:03:18.060,0:03:22.170
they were building and sort of like

0:03:19.680,0:03:24.690
constructing in statistical sort of

0:03:22.170,0:03:26.670
methods at this time but they also

0:03:24.690,0:03:28.380
realized that if they organized and

0:03:26.670,0:03:30.420
regimented the world in really

0:03:28.380,0:03:32.130
constrained ways it would make it easier

0:03:30.420,0:03:34.019
for them to reason and think about it so

0:03:32.130,0:03:35.940
what they did was like they uprooted all

0:03:34.019,0:03:37.530
of these trees and they like replanted

0:03:35.940,0:03:39.570
them so that all like a lot of these

0:03:37.530,0:03:42.239
trees all of the trees in this photo

0:03:39.570,0:03:45.480
were the same species Norway spruce if

0:03:42.239,0:03:47.280
anybody's curious and the same age they

0:03:45.480,0:03:50.600
were organized and are really kind of

0:03:47.280,0:03:53.060
like obsessively clean a neat way and

0:03:50.600,0:03:56.400
Scott talked about this idea of

0:03:53.060,0:03:58.650
basically high modernism this idea not

0:03:56.400,0:04:01.769
just that like geometrically clear and

0:03:58.650,0:04:04.049
sort of like geometrically clean sort of

0:04:01.769,0:04:06.450
patterns are satisfying to people but

0:04:04.049,0:04:08.310
that like there's a moral value to it

0:04:06.450,0:04:11.220
that this is actually sort of like

0:04:08.310,0:04:13.140
morally ethically good to make things

0:04:11.220,0:04:15.510
sort of like clear and clean for people

0:04:13.140,0:04:17.700
to reason about and make sense of so

0:04:15.510,0:04:19.229
this this is sort of this turning the

0:04:17.700,0:04:20.820
interpretation of the world a very

0:04:19.229,0:04:23.970
constrained very geometrically patterned

0:04:20.820,0:04:25.950
very clear sort of world into the

0:04:23.970,0:04:27.150
imposition of it like actually uprooting

0:04:25.950,0:04:30.930
entire forests and reap

0:04:27.150,0:04:33.210
them and this was fine for a while but

0:04:30.930,0:04:35.610
then about 70 or 80 years later it

0:04:33.210,0:04:37.169
wasn't so fine a number of things

0:04:35.610,0:04:41.039
happened that caused serious

0:04:37.169,0:04:43.039
catastrophes first pests when you change

0:04:41.039,0:04:46.259
the entire forest to be one species

0:04:43.039,0:04:47.250
pests go they love it like they have a

0:04:46.259,0:04:49.169
field day

0:04:47.250,0:04:51.449
because Norway spruce isn't particularly

0:04:49.169,0:04:53.419
sort of resilient against certain kinds

0:04:51.449,0:04:56.220
of pests and those pests just went crazy

0:04:53.419,0:04:57.479
there were storms in the previous photo

0:04:56.220,0:04:58.800
you saw that all the trees were roughly

0:04:57.479,0:05:00.600
the same age they were roughly the same

0:04:58.800,0:05:03.000
height they're roughly the same sort of

0:05:00.600,0:05:04.830
mass and when big storms came through

0:05:03.000,0:05:06.449
rather than the big trees sort of

0:05:04.830,0:05:10.289
blocking the winds and the rains and the

0:05:06.449,0:05:12.180
storms in for the sort of defense of the

0:05:10.289,0:05:14.100
smaller trees all of these trees that

0:05:12.180,0:05:16.620
were basically the same age got kind of

0:05:14.100,0:05:18.060
destroyed all at once and then there was

0:05:16.620,0:05:20.669
the hollowing out of the ecosystem

0:05:18.060,0:05:23.550
itself is as part of the sort of

0:05:20.669,0:05:24.810
cleaning of the forest people got rid of

0:05:23.550,0:05:28.680
the underbrush they got rid of the

0:05:24.810,0:05:31.229
passing sort of fauna and flora they

0:05:28.680,0:05:33.780
basically turned the forest into just

0:05:31.229,0:05:37.169
trees and as a result of that it turns

0:05:33.780,0:05:39.360
out those animals and those insects and

0:05:37.169,0:05:43.169
those plants were necessary as part of

0:05:39.360,0:05:46.349
like the ongoing total holistic ecology

0:05:43.169,0:05:48.539
of the system and so what happened was

0:05:46.349,0:05:51.870
what they called vaults turbine which

0:05:48.539,0:05:52.979
turns out to me in forests death and

0:05:51.870,0:05:55.409
that's kind of terrifying

0:05:52.979,0:05:56.849
they lost something like 30 to 60

0:05:55.409,0:05:58.650
percent of the forests before they

0:05:56.849,0:06:01.349
realized what was going on before a

0:05:58.650,0:06:03.389
national campaign to rebuild the forest

0:06:01.349,0:06:06.389
and introduce spiders and insects and

0:06:03.389,0:06:08.039
all of the other pieces of wildlife back

0:06:06.389,0:06:09.900
into the forest to try to bring it back

0:06:08.039,0:06:12.330
from the brink of death were ultimately

0:06:09.900,0:06:15.270
successful but it was it was close and

0:06:12.330,0:06:17.250
it was scary it turned out that the

0:06:15.270,0:06:19.380
forest was more than just the trees it

0:06:17.250,0:06:24.000
was everything that lived in and passed

0:06:19.380,0:06:26.159
through that entire sphere okay so why

0:06:24.000,0:06:28.199
did I tell you about trees just now I

0:06:26.159,0:06:29.789
think that narratives matter and I think

0:06:28.199,0:06:31.620
that it's important how we frame and

0:06:29.789,0:06:33.330
make sense of this stuff because it

0:06:31.620,0:06:37.529
helps us make sense of where we should

0:06:33.330,0:06:40.610
be going and where we are so in this

0:06:37.529,0:06:43.099
talk which hopefully I won't go over on

0:06:40.610,0:06:46.069
I think that I want to make three kind

0:06:43.099,0:06:48.680
of major arguments the first being that

0:06:46.069,0:06:50.479
we turn our really messy world into data

0:06:48.680,0:06:54.319
to reason about it and to inform our

0:06:50.479,0:06:55.849
actions second that that's becoming a

0:06:54.319,0:06:59.389
growing problem as we build systems

0:06:55.849,0:07:01.460
directly out of data and then third that

0:06:59.389,0:07:03.380
people respond to that and that I think

0:07:01.460,0:07:05.060
where we're going is that people are

0:07:03.380,0:07:06.860
starting to perform for the algorithms

0:07:05.060,0:07:08.150
that dictate and direct our lives and

0:07:06.860,0:07:10.550
I'm worried about where that's going to

0:07:08.150,0:07:12.380
lead us so there are these three sort of

0:07:10.550,0:07:14.479
arguments that I'm going to make I'm not

0:07:12.380,0:07:15.949
totally sure how I feel about any or all

0:07:14.479,0:07:18.020
of them and so I'm curious what all of

0:07:15.949,0:07:20.080
your thoughts are but let's get started

0:07:18.020,0:07:23.569
with the first one where we've been

0:07:20.080,0:07:26.599
turning the messy world into clean sort

0:07:23.569,0:07:31.550
of data to whatever extent that data is

0:07:26.599,0:07:33.080
even clean or accurate okay so this is

0:07:31.550,0:07:35.270
part of the sort of narrative history

0:07:33.080,0:07:36.680
sort of thing how many of you have just

0:07:35.270,0:07:40.639
by a show of hands have heard of the

0:07:36.680,0:07:43.009
mother of all demos okay interesting if

0:07:40.639,0:07:45.259
you're not familiar the mother of all

0:07:43.009,0:07:48.590
demos was sort of this demonstration

0:07:45.259,0:07:52.370
about in 1968 but yeah of course on the

0:07:48.590,0:07:53.900
screen in 1968 that introduced a lot of

0:07:52.370,0:07:55.940
the paradigms that you are probably

0:07:53.900,0:07:57.740
using on your computers right now the

0:07:55.940,0:08:01.280
idea of like a text cursor of

0:07:57.740,0:08:03.139
teleconferencing of just editing text in

0:08:01.280,0:08:05.530
general like this was introduced here in

0:08:03.139,0:08:09.139
like an hour and a half long demo that

0:08:05.530,0:08:10.849
had never been seen before and many

0:08:09.139,0:08:12.139
people in computer science and in

0:08:10.849,0:08:13.880
engineering and talk about it as the

0:08:12.139,0:08:15.919
beginning of user interface paradigms

0:08:13.880,0:08:18.169
that have influenced the world for the

0:08:15.919,0:08:21.169
next 50 60 probably will be the next

0:08:18.169,0:08:22.610
hundred years but a different

0:08:21.169,0:08:24.530
perspective on that is that this is the

0:08:22.610,0:08:26.539
conclusion of a decade of military

0:08:24.530,0:08:28.669
research a decade of research that was

0:08:26.539,0:08:30.710
funded by the military during the Cold

0:08:28.669,0:08:33.550
War to figure out how to bomb places

0:08:30.710,0:08:37.159
more effectively and more efficiently

0:08:33.550,0:08:39.589
now you could reasonably ask why this

0:08:37.159,0:08:41.779
matters and the reason I think that it

0:08:39.589,0:08:44.089
matters is because less than 50 years

0:08:41.779,0:08:46.670
later 30 years less than 30 years later

0:08:44.089,0:08:48.770
John Perry Barlow wrote the Declaration

0:08:46.670,0:08:50.000
of Independence of Spira sorry the

0:08:48.770,0:08:52.400
Declaration of the independence of

0:08:50.000,0:08:54.180
cyberspace where he talked about this

0:08:52.400,0:08:55.560
idea that we have no elected government

0:08:54.180,0:08:56.880
or we likely to have one that

0:08:55.560,0:08:58.529
governments derive their powers from the

0:08:56.880,0:09:00.450
consent of the governed and that within

0:08:58.529,0:09:02.970
that we haven't given that to them and

0:09:00.450,0:09:06.390
he he wrote this like on the internet

0:09:02.970,0:09:08.399
and posted it onto the onto a network

0:09:06.390,0:09:10.860
that was built by government funding

0:09:08.399,0:09:12.270
that was built by military funding um

0:09:10.860,0:09:13.470
and so I don't necessarily think that

0:09:12.270,0:09:16.500
like I would say that like this was a

0:09:13.470,0:09:17.910
huge sort of hypocritical like blunder

0:09:16.500,0:09:21.089
on his part but I think that it was

0:09:17.910,0:09:23.550
clearly not acknowledging the history

0:09:21.089,0:09:24.990
upon which he was building when he

0:09:23.550,0:09:27.570
talked about these ideas of the

0:09:24.990,0:09:30.089
Declaration of like a sort of breaking

0:09:27.570,0:09:33.420
away from from physical Geographic

0:09:30.089,0:09:34.950
embodied space and they think that that

0:09:33.420,0:09:38.640
sort of translates into where we are now

0:09:34.950,0:09:42.270
in this idea of kind of building human

0:09:38.640,0:09:44.730
centered AI you all have read about the

0:09:42.270,0:09:47.070
H AI there was the launch of the

0:09:44.730,0:09:48.810
Institute wait sorry the Stanford

0:09:47.070,0:09:51.390
Institute for human centered artificial

0:09:48.810,0:09:57.570
intelligence I wrote about it at length

0:09:51.390,0:09:58.830
I had thoughts but the real question and

0:09:57.570,0:10:00.870
the real issue that I wanted to talk

0:09:58.830,0:10:03.870
about with it with that post and that I

0:10:00.870,0:10:06.000
want to talk about now is that I have

0:10:03.870,0:10:07.560
real questions about what future we're

0:10:06.000,0:10:10.470
building with the stakeholders that are

0:10:07.560,0:10:11.520
in the room it at the H AI do they have

0:10:10.470,0:10:12.870
the knowledge do they have the

0:10:11.520,0:10:14.790
experience do they have the

0:10:12.870,0:10:16.350
methodological backgrounds do they have

0:10:14.790,0:10:19.050
the incentives even to solve any of

0:10:16.350,0:10:20.730
these problems I'm not totally sure that

0:10:19.050,0:10:23.010
they do and in fact it worried me to the

0:10:20.730,0:10:25.800
point that I couldn't continue to be

0:10:23.010,0:10:26.910
there anymore and I think that this is

0:10:25.800,0:10:28.350
becoming a growing problem as we

0:10:26.910,0:10:31.620
continue to build systems and as

0:10:28.350,0:10:34.020
artificial intelligence turns data that

0:10:31.620,0:10:34.440
we've collected and sort of aggregated

0:10:34.020,0:10:38.610
for it

0:10:34.440,0:10:40.290
into into these systems themselves now

0:10:38.610,0:10:42.480
there are all sorts of examples of

0:10:40.290,0:10:45.150
artificial intelligence making really

0:10:42.480,0:10:47.790
frustrating stupid errors in judgment or

0:10:45.150,0:10:49.890
errors and misen classification or what

0:10:47.790,0:10:53.089
have you and we could go on and on and

0:10:49.890,0:10:55.350
on and on with all of the terrible

0:10:53.089,0:10:56.790
errors that these algorithmic systems

0:10:55.350,0:10:58.350
have made but I think it's sort of

0:10:56.790,0:11:00.920
empirically the case that these

0:10:58.350,0:11:02.760
algorithmic systems are taking data that

0:11:00.920,0:11:05.970
we've collected without being

0:11:02.760,0:11:08.010
particularly critically analytical about

0:11:05.970,0:11:10.770
what that data what those

0:11:08.010,0:11:12.210
say and sort of thrown them at these

0:11:10.770,0:11:14.400
systems and ask them to develop patterns

0:11:12.210,0:11:16.560
but I read about that in this paper

0:11:14.400,0:11:19.020
about street level algorithms if you're

0:11:16.560,0:11:20.910
curious there's the whole paper about it

0:11:19.020,0:11:23.040
but basically the gist is that

0:11:20.910,0:11:25.250
algorithmic systems look at look for

0:11:23.040,0:11:27.630
patterns in the data that we give it and

0:11:25.250,0:11:29.370
those algorithms don't necessarily have

0:11:27.630,0:11:32.760
the ability to reflect on what they're

0:11:29.370,0:11:34.230
observing or to even think critically

0:11:32.760,0:11:37.560
about what are the limitations of the

0:11:34.230,0:11:40.140
data that they're fed and that causes

0:11:37.560,0:11:41.850
all sorts of problems there are these

0:11:40.140,0:11:43.350
frustrations that emerge when we have

0:11:41.850,0:11:45.600
these reductive systems that tell us

0:11:43.350,0:11:47.850
like you should be taking 10,000 steps

0:11:45.600,0:11:49.770
or what have you I don't even remember

0:11:47.850,0:11:51.480
what some of these data points are some

0:11:49.770,0:11:54.240
of them are like how many hours I was

0:11:51.480,0:11:57.480
standing up or how many steps I took or

0:11:54.240,0:12:00.180
what my heart rate was or whatever but

0:11:57.480,0:12:02.670
these are all basically like really

0:12:00.180,0:12:05.820
crummy measures that sort of approximate

0:12:02.670,0:12:07.740
in really crummy ways like fitness and

0:12:05.820,0:12:09.360
like no matter how many of these things

0:12:07.740,0:12:12.330
that you collect you're never gonna have

0:12:09.360,0:12:14.640
like a really good sort of holistic view

0:12:12.330,0:12:15.780
of like how fit or how healthy a person

0:12:14.640,0:12:17.280
is you're just gonna have a bunch of

0:12:15.780,0:12:18.570
data points that you can ultimately sort

0:12:17.280,0:12:20.460
of like draw a boundary around and say

0:12:18.570,0:12:23.160
like I guess I'm gonna say this is

0:12:20.460,0:12:25.410
fitness and that's frustrating but it's

0:12:23.160,0:12:27.210
also really damaging because it it

0:12:25.410,0:12:30.960
encourages people to try to live

0:12:27.210,0:12:32.400
according to certain metrics and maybe

0:12:30.960,0:12:33.960
even optimize for certain ones like

0:12:32.400,0:12:38.340
right now I'm tricking my watch into

0:12:33.960,0:12:40.530
thinking I'm exercising and I don't

0:12:38.340,0:12:42.810
think that that necessarily benefits any

0:12:40.530,0:12:43.860
of us personally and I do think that it

0:12:42.810,0:12:46.800
benefits the companies that are

0:12:43.860,0:12:49.350
collecting these data but I think that

0:12:46.800,0:12:50.310
like the sort of deeper longer term

0:12:49.350,0:12:52.550
problem that worries me

0:12:50.310,0:12:55.440
is that when we talk about things like

0:12:52.550,0:12:58.830
driving for instance and there are like

0:12:55.440,0:13:00.420
some reasonably recent papers that have

0:12:58.830,0:13:01.260
come out just in the last year I think

0:13:00.420,0:13:03.270
that really what we should be talking

0:13:01.260,0:13:05.190
about is not the technical stuff the

0:13:03.270,0:13:06.210
metrics that we're optimizing for but we

0:13:05.190,0:13:08.010
should be talking about the social

0:13:06.210,0:13:09.540
problems that precipitated those

0:13:08.010,0:13:11.190
problems in the first place we should be

0:13:09.540,0:13:13.290
talking about how we've built cities to

0:13:11.190,0:13:15.690
be pro cars to the point of being

0:13:13.290,0:13:18.090
dangerous for pedestrians when we talk

0:13:15.690,0:13:20.340
about clinical decision making systems

0:13:18.090,0:13:21.620
then how algorithmic systems are like

0:13:20.340,0:13:23.120
sort of problematic and

0:13:21.620,0:13:24.770
people don't necessarily follow the

0:13:23.120,0:13:27.190
instructions and all that other stuff we

0:13:24.770,0:13:30.020
should instead talk about the history of

0:13:27.190,0:13:32.350
Western doctors doing conducting

0:13:30.020,0:13:34.750
experiments on people of color and

0:13:32.350,0:13:37.250
establishing a very well earned

0:13:34.750,0:13:40.160
reputation of being horrible

0:13:37.250,0:13:42.380
transgressors of human rights and when

0:13:40.160,0:13:44.110
we talk about things like evaluating

0:13:42.380,0:13:46.550
bias and algorithmic systems and

0:13:44.110,0:13:48.440
thinking about sort of like prisons and

0:13:46.550,0:13:50.270
whatnot we should really think about the

0:13:48.440,0:13:52.730
carceral state and the social

0:13:50.270,0:13:55.550
environment that precipitated an entire

0:13:52.730,0:13:56.990
an entire industry basically of slave

0:13:55.550,0:14:00.560
labor that continues to this day

0:13:56.990,0:14:04.430
in prisons that motivates judges and

0:14:00.560,0:14:07.100
police and legislators to put people in

0:14:04.430,0:14:11.180
prison for the purpose of extracting

0:14:07.100,0:14:12.770
labor from them so something that I kind

0:14:11.180,0:14:15.650
of want to spend a couple of minutes

0:14:12.770,0:14:17.930
from people just sort of thinking

0:14:15.650,0:14:19.070
amongst yourselves about is what does

0:14:17.930,0:14:21.200
the world look like that's built

0:14:19.070,0:14:23.960
uncritically on historical foundations

0:14:21.200,0:14:25.790
of greed and exploitation and harm and

0:14:23.960,0:14:28.220
sort of like how do we perform for

0:14:25.790,0:14:29.990
algorithmic audiences right now and just

0:14:28.220,0:14:34.490
to give like some examples I have some

0:14:29.990,0:14:35.660
sort of kind of jokey prompts that sort

0:14:34.490,0:14:37.310
of illustrate that people are sort of

0:14:35.660,0:14:40.670
started to respond to the algorithmic

0:14:37.310,0:14:42.470
systems themselves and performing I

0:14:40.670,0:14:44.270
don't asleep for the algorithms benefit

0:14:42.470,0:14:47.420
but for the algorithms satisfaction

0:14:44.270,0:14:49.279
certainly and there's sort of like some

0:14:47.420,0:14:51.589
fun examples so ways to undermine a

0:14:49.279,0:14:54.320
police state in Hong Kong a lot of

0:14:51.589,0:14:55.880
people were shining lasers at cameras

0:14:54.320,0:14:57.380
and whatnot it wasn't super clear

0:14:55.880,0:14:59.510
whether that was doing anything

0:14:57.380,0:15:01.850
effectively but the sort of folk wisdom

0:14:59.510,0:15:03.709
was that the lasers would like mess up

0:15:01.850,0:15:05.380
the cameras sensors and it would make it

0:15:03.709,0:15:07.540
difficult for them to identify the

0:15:05.380,0:15:10.430
people that were protesting in Hong Kong

0:15:07.540,0:15:11.540
in if you want to get a slightly more

0:15:10.430,0:15:13.760
personal than that you could wear a

0:15:11.540,0:15:15.890
shirt that has all these photos of in

0:15:13.760,0:15:18.230
this case Michael Jackson and it would

0:15:15.890,0:15:19.430
sort of like frustrate a computer vision

0:15:18.230,0:15:20.360
system that would try to figure out who

0:15:19.430,0:15:21.890
you are because it would just see

0:15:20.360,0:15:23.150
Michael Jackson all over you

0:15:21.890,0:15:24.770
and if you wanna get even more personal

0:15:23.150,0:15:27.650
than that you could put makeup on your

0:15:24.770,0:15:29.029
face which presumably confuses the

0:15:27.650,0:15:31.310
computer vision systems and makes it

0:15:29.029,0:15:32.959
difficult for to recognise that one you

0:15:31.310,0:15:35.170
are a person and that you have a face

0:15:32.959,0:15:37.930
and to who you are

0:15:35.170,0:15:39.579
so yeah what I'd like all of you to do

0:15:37.930,0:15:42.940
is sort of like turn to each other and

0:15:39.579,0:15:45.550
think about this question and maybe if

0:15:42.940,0:15:46.810
you run out of things think about what

0:15:45.550,0:15:49.389
it would look like if a world was built

0:15:46.810,0:15:51.339
intentionally with the histories that

0:15:49.389,0:15:54.070
I've talked about in mind so that we

0:15:51.339,0:15:56.649
could actually intentionally sort of

0:15:54.070,0:15:58.779
consciously move away from that and what

0:15:56.649,0:16:01.420
would it look like to build a system or

0:15:58.779,0:16:03.190
to build a world that that consciously

0:16:01.420,0:16:05.800
moved away from those from those

0:16:03.190,0:16:07.959
histories so take I guess two or three

0:16:05.800,0:16:10.329
minutes and talk amongst yourselves in

0:16:07.959,0:16:18.490
groups of three or four and we'll come

0:16:10.329,0:16:21.190
back Wow okay having power is great so

0:16:18.490,0:16:22.779
yeah does anybody have any thoughts that

0:16:21.190,0:16:26.010
they'd like to share about I guess

0:16:22.779,0:16:28.839
either ways that they think about how I

0:16:26.010,0:16:30.910
guess like we sort of exist in this sort

0:16:28.839,0:16:40.120
of uncritically built space or potential

0:16:30.910,0:16:42.250
alternative futures yep yeah sort of I

0:16:40.120,0:16:44.380
think one example that kind of looked at

0:16:42.250,0:16:46.690
both so when you look at like gross

0:16:44.380,0:16:48.250
domestic product GDP you should have

0:16:46.690,0:16:50.170
have to have an inherent bias against

0:16:48.250,0:16:53.079
all the existing metrics because sort of

0:16:50.170,0:16:54.519
they were to be measured it takes active

0:16:53.079,0:16:56.410
work which means that there must be an

0:16:54.519,0:16:59.170
entrenched house for protecting the act

0:16:56.410,0:17:01.600
of measurement and though I found us

0:16:59.170,0:17:03.610
something to intention of those

0:17:01.600,0:17:04.540
histories only appears an economist with

0:17:03.610,0:17:07.630
the Santa Fe Institute

0:17:04.540,0:17:08.620
proposed the domestic product which is

0:17:07.630,0:17:10.660
saying it's not looking at the average

0:17:08.620,0:17:12.250
of every dollar over time look at every

0:17:10.660,0:17:14.620
person an average every person together

0:17:12.250,0:17:17.020
so if even one person goes to zero

0:17:14.620,0:17:19.600
income the whole thing is going to go go

0:17:17.020,0:17:22.089
down and sort of like sort of the area

0:17:19.600,0:17:23.650
distant you know ensemble not the

0:17:22.089,0:17:25.780
ensemble average with the time series

0:17:23.650,0:17:27.250
average for each person and so I think

0:17:25.780,0:17:29.950
that in general trying to think of how

0:17:27.250,0:17:32.860
do I humanize a metric more is the way

0:17:29.950,0:17:34.090
to build intentionally and I think that

0:17:32.860,0:17:36.220
when you look at an existing measure

0:17:34.090,0:17:38.020
give again from using it why who's

0:17:36.220,0:17:40.030
allowing them to continue measuring it

0:17:38.020,0:17:41.410
yeah that's a really great point

0:17:40.030,0:17:43.510
I guess if anybody has any other

0:17:41.410,0:17:45.850
thoughts I can like vamp for a few

0:17:43.510,0:17:47.750
seconds

0:17:45.850,0:17:49.760
okay well feel free to raise your hand

0:17:47.750,0:17:52.370
while I talk for a minute yeah that's a

0:17:49.760,0:17:53.510
really great point there's a book called

0:17:52.370,0:17:55.310
measuring what counts

0:17:53.510,0:17:56.630
which sort of talks about a lot of this

0:17:55.310,0:17:59.570
stuff and they're like former White

0:17:56.630,0:18:01.070
House economists who were basically

0:17:59.570,0:18:03.650
talking about like how we had all these

0:18:01.070,0:18:05.540
great metrics for the economy and they

0:18:03.650,0:18:07.400
weren't accurately reflecting like the

0:18:05.540,0:18:08.870
reality like the lived experience of a

0:18:07.400,0:18:12.650
lot of the people that were that were

0:18:08.870,0:18:14.060
not experiencing like super great stock

0:18:12.650,0:18:20.620
market is it like sort of like

0:18:14.060,0:18:20.620
performance and whatnot any other yeah

0:18:24.640,0:18:27.739
[Music]

0:18:38.680,0:18:45.260
how many languages are there in the

0:18:42.350,0:18:48.190
Philippines there's about 7,000 I lived

0:18:45.260,0:18:50.090
in 700 languages and so that Facebook

0:18:48.190,0:18:51.890
permanents the way that they measure how

0:18:50.090,0:18:55.010
they take cases like whether if you need

0:18:51.890,0:18:56.600
more something else the metric scale but

0:18:55.010,0:18:59.210
if you look at generally

0:18:56.600,0:19:01.100
underrepresented using any say the word

0:18:59.210,0:19:03.740
underrepresented versus minority like

0:19:01.100,0:19:06.910
California has majority quote-unquote

0:19:03.740,0:19:08.980
Latinos but they are underrepresented

0:19:06.910,0:19:11.750
Asian Americans are very

0:19:08.980,0:19:15.620
underrepresented in number but then you

0:19:11.750,0:19:18.200
compare like in Asia it just like the

0:19:15.620,0:19:19.790
way that these terms that they're so in

0:19:18.200,0:19:22.400
historical and how we're measuring

0:19:19.790,0:19:24.560
things itself what would it look like if

0:19:22.400,0:19:28.640
you were to take that into account as

0:19:24.560,0:19:31.610
very complex I think by country and by

0:19:28.640,0:19:35.300
history of colonialism that it makes it

0:19:31.610,0:19:37.430
so difficult to measure it but I think

0:19:35.300,0:19:40.220
the hardest part would I hi - scale and

0:19:37.430,0:19:43.370
if you visited the Philippine Consulate

0:19:40.220,0:19:45.770
trying to describe to entrepreneurs who

0:19:43.370,0:19:48.500
were tech versus small business and I

0:19:45.770,0:19:50.150
said well most of these investors the

0:19:48.500,0:19:51.740
way they evaluate things is does this

0:19:50.150,0:19:53.930
scale and like that is a very

0:19:51.740,0:19:57.320
capitalistic notion that I was framing

0:19:53.930,0:19:57.870
as much as like I hate that like the

0:19:57.320,0:20:00.210
case

0:19:57.870,0:20:02.340
for tech so it's really hard to just

0:20:00.210,0:20:04.320
figure out like what would make this a

0:20:02.340,0:20:08.789
much more humane environment for

0:20:04.320,0:20:10.529
technology okay great well if you have

0:20:08.789,0:20:12.120
any more thoughts I'd love to hear it in

0:20:10.529,0:20:14.790
the forum and stuff so feel free to

0:20:12.120,0:20:15.950
chime in there Thanks

0:20:14.790,0:20:19.019
