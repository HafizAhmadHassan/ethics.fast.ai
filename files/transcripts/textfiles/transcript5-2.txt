0:00:00.030,0:00:05.700
let's get started for kind of final

0:00:02.730,0:00:10.620
final class I'm gonna be finishing up

0:00:05.700,0:00:12.179
the lesson on our ecosystem well so I

0:00:10.620,0:00:14.910
just briefly wanted to review what I was

0:00:12.179,0:00:17.310
talking about last week talked about

0:00:14.910,0:00:19.430
good hearts law when a measure becomes a

0:00:17.310,0:00:21.930
target it ceases to be a good measure

0:00:19.430,0:00:24.539
another variation of this is Campbell's

0:00:21.930,0:00:25.800
law the more any quantitative social

0:00:24.539,0:00:27.810
indicator is used for social

0:00:25.800,0:00:29.609
decision-making the more subject it will

0:00:27.810,0:00:31.019
be to corruption pressures and the more

0:00:29.609,0:00:33.600
apt it will be to distort and corrupt

0:00:31.019,0:00:37.860
the social processes it's intended to

0:00:33.600,0:00:40.200
mirror to monitor and so I've written

0:00:37.860,0:00:42.899
about this more in a blog post and later

0:00:40.200,0:00:48.090
a paper that over emphasizing metrics

0:00:42.899,0:00:50.129
can lead to manipulation gaming my my

0:00:48.090,0:00:52.020
Opik focus on short-term goals because

0:00:50.129,0:00:54.270
it's much easier to measure short-term

0:00:52.020,0:00:56.719
quantities as opposed to kind of

0:00:54.270,0:00:59.760
long-term complex relationships

0:00:56.719,0:01:01.920
unexpected negative consequences and

0:00:59.760,0:01:06.470
unfortunately a lot of AI and machine

0:01:01.920,0:01:06.470
learning centers on optimizing a metric

0:01:06.890,0:01:11.760
so one example I shared last week came

0:01:09.540,0:01:14.430
from England's health care system which

0:01:11.760,0:01:15.930
in the early 2000s implemented a number

0:01:14.430,0:01:18.960
of kind of performance metrics for

0:01:15.930,0:01:22.700
accountability there were targets around

0:01:18.960,0:01:24.840
shortening ER wait times and this led to

0:01:22.700,0:01:27.930
hospitals canceling scheduled operations

0:01:24.840,0:01:31.049
so that they could send extra staff into

0:01:27.930,0:01:33.119
the ER requiring patients to wait in

0:01:31.049,0:01:34.799
lines of ambulances outside the hospital

0:01:33.119,0:01:37.590
because that didn't count as part of

0:01:34.799,0:01:39.270
their ER wait time turning stretchers

0:01:37.590,0:01:42.000
into beds by putting them in hallways

0:01:39.270,0:01:44.220
and discrepancies in the numbers

0:01:42.000,0:01:46.290
reported by hospitals versus by patients

0:01:44.220,0:01:47.759
so if you asked hospitals how long

0:01:46.290,0:01:48.990
people were waiting you're getting very

0:01:47.759,0:01:52.860
different answers than if you ask

0:01:48.990,0:01:54.990
patients how long they were waiting in

0:01:52.860,0:01:57.570
the US we've seen a lot of pressure

0:01:54.990,0:01:59.490
around standardized testing leading to

0:01:57.570,0:02:02.610
kind of widespread cheating scandals by

0:01:59.490,0:02:05.280
school systems as well as kind of

0:02:02.610,0:02:06.570
schools of focusing so myopically on

0:02:05.280,0:02:10.120
teaching to the task that they're

0:02:06.570,0:02:13.400
leaving out a lot of other things

0:02:10.120,0:02:14.599
one of so that's just kind of a brief

0:02:13.400,0:02:17.120
review about some of the issues with

0:02:14.599,0:02:20.530
metrics one of the readings from week

0:02:17.120,0:02:23.420
five that we didn't get to last time was

0:02:20.530,0:02:26.719
the platform is the message by James

0:02:23.420,0:02:30.319
grimmelman as I enjoyed this and he

0:02:26.719,0:02:33.829
talks about how kind of with meme

0:02:30.319,0:02:37.310
culture there's no example of a kind of

0:02:33.829,0:02:39.709
totally kind of pure and earnest

0:02:37.310,0:02:42.290
statement but also it's never kind of

0:02:39.709,0:02:44.810
totally ironic or a joke either that

0:02:42.290,0:02:47.959
there's kind of this in-between and that

0:02:44.810,0:02:50.870
he gives this example about eating the

0:02:47.959,0:02:52.430
tide pod challenge which kind of the

0:02:50.870,0:02:55.310
earliest mention of was this onion

0:02:52.430,0:02:59.120
article from 2015 which clearly seemed

0:02:55.310,0:03:01.639
to be a joke but then when this became

0:02:59.120,0:03:03.469
an issue you had people kind of even in

0:03:01.639,0:03:06.319
denouncing the tide pot challenge is

0:03:03.469,0:03:08.239
very dangerous that's you know further

0:03:06.319,0:03:10.269
promoting it and kind of encouraging its

0:03:08.239,0:03:13.099
spread

0:03:10.269,0:03:15.229
he wrote online culture is awash in

0:03:13.099,0:03:17.299
layers of irony there's a sense in which

0:03:15.229,0:03:19.699
there's no such thing as a pure exemplar

0:03:17.299,0:03:21.769
of eating a tide pod and ironically

0:03:19.699,0:03:23.780
or a critique of the practice that is

0:03:21.769,0:03:27.259
not all also in part an advertisement

0:03:23.780,0:03:29.389
for it and then a quote I particularly

0:03:27.259,0:03:31.220
like is he highlighted that the

0:03:29.389,0:03:34.069
platform's are structurally at war with

0:03:31.220,0:03:35.829
themselves the same characteristics that

0:03:34.069,0:03:38.150
make outrageous and offensive content

0:03:35.829,0:03:41.090
unacceptable are what make it go viral

0:03:38.150,0:03:43.340
in the first place so I'd ask if there

0:03:41.090,0:03:49.879
are any kind of reactions to this paper

0:03:43.340,0:03:53.659
from last week anyone in the room all

0:03:49.879,0:03:56.359
right another paper I liked and I think

0:03:53.659,0:03:58.699
this was an optional reading was by Tom

0:03:56.359,0:04:01.189
sleeve incompatible incentives of

0:03:58.699,0:04:04.009
private sector AI and he talks about

0:04:01.189,0:04:06.530
this idea of the algorithm guardrail

0:04:04.009,0:04:09.409
arbitrage which is when a recommendation

0:04:06.530,0:04:11.959
system is promoting content that

0:04:09.409,0:04:13.669
violates its community guidelines so

0:04:11.959,0:04:15.409
they're the guardrails are kind of the

0:04:13.669,0:04:18.729
community guidelines of what's

0:04:15.409,0:04:21.199
unacceptable or should be taken down and

0:04:18.729,0:04:22.460
that often these things are in conflict

0:04:21.199,0:04:24.380
that

0:04:22.460,0:04:25.970
accomodation system is promoting

0:04:24.380,0:04:28.060
something that maybe technically is

0:04:25.970,0:04:30.199
against the the community guidelines

0:04:28.060,0:04:32.990
however companies have a financial

0:04:30.199,0:04:35.630
incentive to keep that gap wide and they

0:04:32.990,0:04:37.310
can kind of arbitrage across kind of you

0:04:35.630,0:04:39.530
know if they're called out pointing to

0:04:37.310,0:04:41.840
their guidelines of like oh no we don't

0:04:39.530,0:04:44.330
support this sort of thing yet

0:04:41.840,0:04:46.870
continuing to profit in instances where

0:04:44.330,0:04:49.069
they're they're not called out about it

0:04:46.870,0:04:52.669
and I thought that was a kind of helpful

0:04:49.069,0:04:55.610
helpful framing and again it points to

0:04:52.669,0:05:00.500
this kind of a structural tension or

0:04:55.610,0:05:02.030
even war of kind of the misaligned are

0:05:00.500,0:05:05.139
kind of different incentives depending

0:05:02.030,0:05:05.139
on your perspective

0:05:06.580,0:05:11.990
sleeo also writes about how social media

0:05:09.470,0:05:15.530
recommender algorithms have three

0:05:11.990,0:05:18.680
qualities needed for highly elastic but

0:05:15.530,0:05:20.389
also highly fragile systems those are

0:05:18.680,0:05:23.020
that experimentation is very affordable

0:05:20.389,0:05:25.909
so people can you know automatically uh

0:05:23.020,0:05:27.560
automate generating content and just put

0:05:25.909,0:05:30.800
a ton of content out there and see

0:05:27.560,0:05:34.330
what's rewarded what's not they get fast

0:05:30.800,0:05:36.800
feedback in the forms of likes and views

0:05:34.330,0:05:38.840
and it has a high impact on the

0:05:36.800,0:05:41.570
recommendation system and these three

0:05:38.840,0:05:43.400
qualities kind of all really encourage

0:05:41.570,0:05:45.500
gaming and manipulation because they

0:05:43.400,0:05:52.400
make it make a cheap and efficient to do

0:05:45.500,0:05:57.710
so alright me check the the group chat

0:05:52.400,0:05:59.630
to see any comments someone said they

0:05:57.710,0:06:05.990
really liked this paper a great

0:05:59.630,0:06:13.090
explanation of meme culture any comments

0:06:05.990,0:06:16.310
from in person alright so the the next

0:06:13.090,0:06:19.969
set of things I want to talk about is to

0:06:16.310,0:06:22.159
kind of understand broadly some of the

0:06:19.969,0:06:24.199
forces at work in tech particularly

0:06:22.159,0:06:27.349
venture capital hyper growth and

0:06:24.199,0:06:29.120
blitzscaling and so I think it's

0:06:27.349,0:06:31.310
important to understand these to kind of

0:06:29.120,0:06:33.460
understand the patterns of why we keep

0:06:31.310,0:06:35.430
seeing companies that

0:06:33.460,0:06:38.380
have some of the same ethical pitfalls

0:06:35.430,0:06:41.520
this reminds me a little bit of Zeynep

0:06:38.380,0:06:43.870
defect ease article on sociological

0:06:41.520,0:06:46.300
storytelling but understanding some of

0:06:43.870,0:06:48.789
the kind of sociological forces that

0:06:46.300,0:06:51.970
have led to kind of our current or

0:06:48.789,0:06:53.710
current state and so I've written a

0:06:51.970,0:06:57.039
little bit in a different context there

0:06:53.710,0:06:58.660
at a blog post two years ago and and I

0:06:57.039,0:07:00.400
want to highlight everything I'm saying

0:06:58.660,0:07:03.490
as a generality like they're definitely

0:07:00.400,0:07:05.470
exceptions to these but on the whole I

0:07:03.490,0:07:08.259
think there are a lot of downsides to

0:07:05.470,0:07:10.360
venture capital into hyper growth and

0:07:08.259,0:07:12.340
this is not to say that they're never

0:07:10.360,0:07:16.060
useful or they're no cases where they're

0:07:12.340,0:07:18.099
where they're helpful I think they

0:07:16.060,0:07:20.050
adventure capital in many cases can push

0:07:18.099,0:07:22.090
what could have been a successful kind

0:07:20.050,0:07:25.060
of sustainable business to over expand

0:07:22.090,0:07:27.849
and ultimately fail and that there's

0:07:25.060,0:07:30.849
often a lot of misalignment of

0:07:27.849,0:07:34.419
incentives between VCS and founders and

0:07:30.849,0:07:36.190
the rest of society more broadly and so

0:07:34.419,0:07:38.470
this is kind of showing up in the media

0:07:36.190,0:07:40.330
more here's a venture capitalist saying

0:07:38.470,0:07:42.729
that the vast majority of entrepreneurs

0:07:40.330,0:07:44.650
should not take venture capital because

0:07:42.729,0:07:48.490
it's a binary swing for the fences

0:07:44.650,0:07:51.820
exercising exercise there was a New York

0:07:48.490,0:07:53.349
Times article on more entrepreneurs that

0:07:51.820,0:07:57.250
are just not even interested in in

0:07:53.349,0:07:59.380
venture capital and so Tim O'Reilly

0:07:57.250,0:08:01.570
talks about kind of a lot of related

0:07:59.380,0:08:05.650
issues in his post that was a sign

0:08:01.570,0:08:09.250
reading last week and kind of the the

0:08:05.650,0:08:11.440
premise of our kind of current system is

0:08:09.250,0:08:13.599
that if a company grows big enough and

0:08:11.440,0:08:15.610
fast enough that profits will eventually

0:08:13.599,0:08:18.250
follow so kind of if you can just get

0:08:15.610,0:08:19.840
really big really fast like it's gonna

0:08:18.250,0:08:25.509
have to work out that you're profitable

0:08:19.840,0:08:27.430
is the the hypothesis and kind of one

0:08:25.509,0:08:30.009
philosophy this goes under is

0:08:27.430,0:08:32.729
blitzscaling which read Hoffman and

0:08:30.009,0:08:35.370
Christie write a book on and it really

0:08:32.729,0:08:38.800
prioritizes speed over efficiency and

0:08:35.370,0:08:40.719
risk potentially disastrous defeat but

0:08:38.800,0:08:44.110
the idea that there's a lot of upsides

0:08:40.719,0:08:46.610
if you're a successful and Tim O'Reilly

0:08:44.110,0:08:51.649
is very critical of this approach and

0:08:46.610,0:08:53.690
is in his article and so first just how

0:08:51.649,0:08:56.060
is the how is this related to data

0:08:53.690,0:08:57.769
ethics and what we're talking about I'm

0:08:56.060,0:09:00.200
having this kind of hyper growth

0:08:57.769,0:09:02.480
typically requires automation and

0:09:00.200,0:09:05.360
reliance on metrics this isn't something

0:09:02.480,0:09:07.970
you can kind of do just just using

0:09:05.360,0:09:09.380
people or human decision-makers you

0:09:07.970,0:09:13.130
typically are going to be having to use

0:09:09.380,0:09:15.260
a lot of automation and data - I think

0:09:13.130,0:09:18.019
that prioritizing speed above all else

0:09:15.260,0:09:21.529
doesn't leave time to reflect on ethics

0:09:18.019,0:09:23.660
and then when you do have problems they

0:09:21.529,0:09:26.120
happen at a large scale and so I think

0:09:23.660,0:09:27.440
if if a company is kind of growing in a

0:09:26.120,0:09:29.420
more sustainable manner

0:09:27.440,0:09:30.529
you know you there might be a problem

0:09:29.420,0:09:32.120
but you can recognize it when the

0:09:30.529,0:09:34.760
company is still small and before it's

0:09:32.120,0:09:39.050
impacted too many people if you kind of

0:09:34.760,0:09:40.940
grow at a very fast scale your problem

0:09:39.050,0:09:45.709
may be impacting millions of people

0:09:40.940,0:09:56.050
before before it becomes apparent ok

0:09:45.709,0:09:58.550
pause here I'll check the a group chat

0:09:56.050,0:10:00.050
can you explain a little bit more about

0:09:58.550,0:10:01.100
why it's important to have high

0:10:00.050,0:10:03.079
elasticity

0:10:01.100,0:10:07.760
I had trouble understanding of the

0:10:03.079,0:10:09.649
concept oh sorry about that there is a

0:10:07.760,0:10:11.449
so that's going back there's a little

0:10:09.649,0:10:16.040
bit of late latency with the YouTube

0:10:11.449,0:10:20.449
stream so let me go back to the slide on

0:10:16.040,0:10:25.640
elasticity and so actually what this was

0:10:20.449,0:10:29.269
saying that is that high elasticity is a

0:10:25.640,0:10:31.820
risk so it's associated with high

0:10:29.269,0:10:34.399
fragility and so kind of the fact that

0:10:31.820,0:10:36.860
people can experiment so easily this is

0:10:34.399,0:10:38.449
actually a bad thing just because it

0:10:36.860,0:10:43.250
leads to a lot of gaming and

0:10:38.449,0:10:46.820
manipulation and so this was kind of

0:10:43.250,0:10:48.620
painting it in a negative light of kind

0:10:46.820,0:10:51.290
of what the risk are of kind of being so

0:10:48.620,0:10:55.720
elastic because the the recommendation

0:10:51.290,0:10:58.310
system is really responding quickly and

0:10:55.720,0:11:00.259
content creators are responding quickly

0:10:58.310,0:11:02.540
in terms of creating lots of content and

0:11:00.259,0:11:05.629
this feedback the system can change very

0:11:02.540,0:11:09.589
quickly but these same factors are what

0:11:05.629,0:11:15.290
lead to to manipulation and so let me go

0:11:09.589,0:11:17.749
back to the the chat and so yeah let me

0:11:15.290,0:11:19.999
know if that explanation was helpful in

0:11:17.749,0:11:23.299
the chat and I'll move on to some of the

0:11:19.999,0:11:25.999
other comments one person said as a VC I

0:11:23.299,0:11:32.989
agree with these points about venture

0:11:25.999,0:11:34.850
capital uber lyft it's gonna be a good

0:11:32.989,0:11:36.439
case study they bootstrap for growth

0:11:34.850,0:11:41.359
without profit bill without

0:11:36.439,0:11:44.289
profitability what happens now and I

0:11:41.359,0:11:47.479
think on the kind of uber lyft example

0:11:44.289,0:11:50.149
something that was to me kind of odd to

0:11:47.479,0:11:53.089
see is I there were you know there were

0:11:50.149,0:11:54.919
cities and areas where uber and lyft

0:11:53.089,0:11:57.019
could be profitable but because they

0:11:54.919,0:11:58.729
were going for this particular uber for

0:11:57.019,0:12:02.410
this kind of world domination approach

0:11:58.729,0:12:04.519
they you know did end up trying to

0:12:02.410,0:12:06.439
compete in a number of markets where

0:12:04.519,0:12:08.359
they were just constantly losing money

0:12:06.439,0:12:11.839
and that they did ultimately pull out of

0:12:08.359,0:12:13.369
particularly in Asia I know so I think

0:12:11.839,0:12:18.439
there's already kind of been a cost to

0:12:13.369,0:12:20.929
that another comment can also state that

0:12:18.439,0:12:22.429
more and more a I powered startups build

0:12:20.929,0:12:24.439
data products and don't think about

0:12:22.429,0:12:28.519
ethical applications during the building

0:12:24.439,0:12:31.279
and testing phases someone says I love

0:12:28.519,0:12:32.470
the long term ism movement such as long

0:12:31.279,0:12:36.230
now

0:12:32.470,0:12:38.689
FHI at Oxford for these kinds of reasons

0:12:36.230,0:12:41.419
kind of the opposite of moving fast and

0:12:38.689,0:12:44.209
breaking things ideologically so those

0:12:41.419,0:12:50.269
are some comments from the chat any

0:12:44.209,0:12:52.669
comments from in person alright so going

0:12:50.269,0:12:54.319
back yeah so we've kind of said there's

0:12:52.669,0:12:56.659
this relationship I think between hyper

0:12:54.319,0:12:59.209
growth and automation and using data and

0:12:56.659,0:13:00.649
also making it harder for people to

0:12:59.209,0:13:04.789
reflect on the ethics of what they're

0:13:00.649,0:13:07.009
doing some other characteristics of what

0:13:04.789,0:13:08.809
happens are that investors end up kind

0:13:07.009,0:13:11.959
of anointing winners as opposed to

0:13:08.809,0:13:14.320
market forces tends to create duopoly

0:13:11.959,0:13:16.820
Zoar monopolies

0:13:14.320,0:13:20.630
it's incredibly difficult for new

0:13:16.820,0:13:25.040
entrants there's a loss of control of

0:13:20.630,0:13:26.690
the company often by founders companies

0:13:25.040,0:13:30.110
can tend to spread themselves too thin

0:13:26.690,0:13:34.400
in trying to achieve this you know kind

0:13:30.110,0:13:37.160
of global monopoly status and tons of

0:13:34.400,0:13:41.320
companies using the strategy fail and so

0:13:37.160,0:13:43.820
there's real survivorship bias in the

0:13:41.320,0:13:47.000
success stories we hear and kind of an

0:13:43.820,0:13:48.290
advice that you get from from VCS always

0:13:47.000,0:13:50.510
be aware of kind of the survivorship

0:13:48.290,0:13:53.540
bias of they're focusing on the few the

0:13:50.510,0:13:56.510
few that were successful however many

0:13:53.540,0:13:58.550
many companies fail and I think that

0:13:56.510,0:14:00.950
kind of taking venture capital in many

0:13:58.550,0:14:04.040
cases can push what could have been a

0:14:00.950,0:14:08.350
kind of successful but small sustainable

0:14:04.040,0:14:08.350
company kind of to this brink of failure

0:14:10.210,0:14:15.500
one of the subject headings in O'Reilly

0:14:13.580,0:14:18.290
article was is it a business or a

0:14:15.500,0:14:21.080
financial instrument and he shares this

0:14:18.290,0:14:25.070
graph which i think is just remarkable

0:14:21.080,0:14:27.820
of the percent of US IPOs with negative

0:14:25.070,0:14:31.089
earnings per share at the time of IPO

0:14:27.820,0:14:34.730
and you can see it is above 80%

0:14:31.089,0:14:37.250
currently so this really high number of

0:14:34.730,0:14:41.390
companies going public that are losing

0:14:37.250,0:14:41.990
money at the time they go public so kind

0:14:41.390,0:14:43.730
of seemingly

0:14:41.990,0:14:46.040
not having achieved a profitable

0:14:43.730,0:14:47.420
business and if you look back kind of

0:14:46.040,0:14:52.790
the only time it's been nearly as high

0:14:47.420,0:14:54.350
was in 2004 the previous calm crash but

0:14:52.790,0:14:57.520
that kind of historically it was at much

0:14:54.350,0:14:57.520
lower number numbers

0:14:59.000,0:15:03.420
quote from the article Silicon Valley

0:15:01.500,0:15:06.089
venture capitalists want entrepreneurs

0:15:03.420,0:15:08.339
to pursue exponential growth even if

0:15:06.089,0:15:12.019
doing so costs more money and increases

0:15:08.339,0:15:12.019
the chances that the business will fail

0:15:13.130,0:15:17.490
so then there's um now I'm getting into

0:15:15.750,0:15:19.560
the kind of this ain't it affect the

0:15:17.490,0:15:21.779
articles she talks about and I think

0:15:19.560,0:15:24.440
this is just kind of so prescient of her

0:15:21.779,0:15:27.750
that she in twenty twelve was already

0:15:24.440,0:15:30.300
really concerned about the growth of the

0:15:27.750,0:15:33.060
kind of the data-driven campaign in the

0:15:30.300,0:15:36.329
harms of that at a time when many people

0:15:33.060,0:15:39.570
were thinking that big data would save

0:15:36.329,0:15:42.540
politics the data had you know played a

0:15:39.570,0:15:45.120
significant role in the Obama Obama

0:15:42.540,0:15:48.000
campaign and in zeyneb says she got a

0:15:45.120,0:15:50.839
lot of negative negative feedback for

0:15:48.000,0:15:57.810
her her New York Times op-ed at the time

0:15:50.839,0:15:59.339
expressing hesitation about this and so

0:15:57.810,0:16:02.670
she she talks about how he kind of went

0:15:59.339,0:16:04.140
from data seeming you know it should be

0:16:02.670,0:16:06.690
this really kind of positive hopeful

0:16:04.140,0:16:09.839
things so it helped Obama get elected it

0:16:06.690,0:16:13.529
was helping people you know kind of

0:16:09.839,0:16:16.100
revolt against dictators to now seeing

0:16:13.529,0:16:19.769
it is having a lot of oppressive

0:16:16.100,0:16:21.390
repressive results digital platforms

0:16:19.769,0:16:23.610
allowed communities to gather and form

0:16:21.390,0:16:28.079
in new ways but they also dispersed

0:16:23.610,0:16:30.810
existing communities then a quote that I

0:16:28.079,0:16:33.449
think about a lot is power always learns

0:16:30.810,0:16:36.089
and powerful tools always fall into its

0:16:33.449,0:16:38.850
hands this is a hard lesson of history

0:16:36.089,0:16:40.949
but a solid one and so that initially

0:16:38.850,0:16:43.920
kind of even though many people whose

0:16:40.949,0:16:46.050
voices you know hadn't been as widely

0:16:43.920,0:16:47.880
heard were able to find a platform

0:16:46.050,0:16:50.069
through through social media and

0:16:47.880,0:16:51.300
technology which was very positive we're

0:16:50.069,0:16:53.579
now seeing the powerful kind of

0:16:51.300,0:16:58.910
manipulated in some harmful ways and

0:16:53.579,0:17:02.519
this kind of rereading this article by

0:16:58.910,0:17:03.959
by Zeynep reminded me of our mediating

0:17:02.519,0:17:06.929
consent article that we read in the

0:17:03.959,0:17:09.030
first week and they are ranae de Resta

0:17:06.929,0:17:12.120
in the context of disinformation talked

0:17:09.030,0:17:14.190
about the shift from in other ways

0:17:12.120,0:17:18.090
the kind of the mainstream centralized

0:17:14.190,0:17:20.760
media failed us such as perhaps not

0:17:18.090,0:17:23.130
enough investigation around the Vietnam

0:17:20.760,0:17:26.040
War and the the downsides there also

0:17:23.130,0:17:28.380
with the Iraq war kind of not pointing

0:17:26.040,0:17:32.520
out the kind of flimsy and false

0:17:28.380,0:17:33.660
evidence however now we're seeing the

0:17:32.520,0:17:36.780
downsides of having kind of such a

0:17:33.660,0:17:41.400
fractured fractured ecosystem where

0:17:36.780,0:17:51.300
their thoughts on on this article I need

0:17:41.400,0:18:02.420
from the in person crowd let me check

0:17:51.300,0:18:06.030
the chat yeah and so the MIT check

0:18:02.420,0:18:07.590
article by Dana pal social media took us

0:18:06.030,0:18:09.720
from to here Square to Donald Trump

0:18:07.590,0:18:12.150
asked how did digital technologies go

0:18:09.720,0:18:13.860
from empowers empowering citizens to

0:18:12.150,0:18:17.520
being used as tools of oppression and

0:18:13.860,0:18:19.320
discord and should have several reasons

0:18:17.520,0:18:21.420
even though dissidents can more easily

0:18:19.320,0:18:23.910
circumvent censorship which is a

0:18:21.420,0:18:26.070
positive the public sphere is now too

0:18:23.910,0:18:31.260
noisy and confusing to have as much of

0:18:26.070,0:18:34.860
an impact the new gatekeepers succeed by

0:18:31.260,0:18:38.250
fueling mistrust and doubt and there's a

0:18:34.860,0:18:40.680
a symmetry there and that people trying

0:18:38.250,0:18:43.440
to enact kind of positive change in the

0:18:40.680,0:18:45.600
world have to you know convince people

0:18:43.440,0:18:47.370
that here's this problem and that is

0:18:45.600,0:18:49.590
something we can address as opposed to

0:18:47.370,0:18:53.670
just getting people to feel mistrustful

0:18:49.590,0:18:57.450
and doubtful as is easier local

0:18:53.670,0:18:59.820
journalism has been broken when we

0:18:57.450,0:19:01.440
encounter opposing views on social media

0:18:59.820,0:19:04.470
it's like hearing them from the opposing

0:19:01.440,0:19:06.030
team in a football stadium and so zeynep

0:19:04.470,0:19:07.410
says it's not it's not that we're like

0:19:06.030,0:19:09.330
in bubbles where we don't hear the other

0:19:07.410,0:19:11.660
side it's that when we do hear them

0:19:09.330,0:19:14.790
we're kind of hearing them in this very

0:19:11.660,0:19:17.280
amped up way you know where we feel kind

0:19:14.790,0:19:19.980
of very charged up for our team and

0:19:17.280,0:19:21.810
against the other team and it often kind

0:19:19.980,0:19:23.399
of drives people even further into their

0:19:21.810,0:19:25.529
existing views

0:19:23.399,0:19:29.729
opposed to kind of reaching a more

0:19:25.529,0:19:33.059
common common understanding we have weak

0:19:29.729,0:19:34.950
digital security in the US and the

0:19:33.059,0:19:37.559
conditions of social distrust weak

0:19:34.950,0:19:38.849
institutions and detached elites made

0:19:37.559,0:19:40.769
the United States particularly

0:19:38.849,0:19:51.299
vulnerable to some of the things we're

0:19:40.769,0:19:53.519
experiencing now okay and then I think I

0:19:51.299,0:19:57.809
oh this is kind of the conclusion of the

0:19:53.519,0:20:00.989
ecosystem part and I will move move into

0:19:57.809,0:20:03.809
week six any more thoughts on kind of

0:20:00.989,0:20:08.279
our ecosystem so this could be anything

0:20:03.809,0:20:11.099
related to metrics the forces on

0:20:08.279,0:20:16.469
companies the dynamics of of social

0:20:11.099,0:20:17.669
media and of these platforms and I

0:20:16.469,0:20:19.499
wanted to talk about these things just

0:20:17.669,0:20:23.129
to try to get that kind of broader view

0:20:19.499,0:20:24.919
of this is these are the forces that

0:20:23.129,0:20:28.249
kind of acting on tech companies and

0:20:24.919,0:20:28.249
influencing us all
