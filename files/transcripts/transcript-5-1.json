  "00:15": "think I'm gonna skip ahead to my section",
  "00:18": "on metrics just because that seems like",
  "00:20": "such a kind of natural direction to go",
  "00:23": "in from here and so I'll cover the other",
  "00:28": "material next week since we definitely",
  "00:32": "won't be finishing but so this is this",
  "00:35": "has come up previously in class this",
  "00:38": "idea of good hearts law that we met when",
  "00:41": "a measure becomes a target it ceases to",
  "00:43": "be a good measure",
  "00:45": "another framing and we're about to see",
  "00:47": "several examples of what this means now",
  "00:50": "their framing of it is Campbell's law",
  "00:53": "which is the more any quantitative",
  "00:55": "social indicator is used for social",
  "00:57": "decision making the more subject it will",
  "00:59": "be to corruption pressures and the more",
  "01:01": "apt it will be to distort and corrupt",
  "01:03": "the social processes it is intended to",
  "01:05": "monitor and so this is a little bit kind",
  "01:08": "of more specific than good hearts law it",
  "01:10": "covers some of the same cases and this",
  "01:15": "is a topic that I wrote a blog post",
  "01:18": "about last year and then ended up kind",
  "01:19": "of extending it into a paper if you want",
  "01:22": "want to hear more about this but this is",
  "01:24": "something that I think is a really kind",
  "01:25": "of fundamental challenge for AI but",
  "01:28": "optimizing metrics can lead to",
  "01:30": "manipulation gaming myopic focus on",

  "01:52": "[Music]",
  "01:54": "so one example that we saw back in week",
  "01:57": "two of something that can go wrong is",
  "02:00": "measurement bias and so we talked about",
  "02:02": "a paper then where the researchers",
  "02:04": "wanted to predict who's most likely to",
  "02:07": "have a stroke and this could be used to",

  "03:09": "way that metrics can fail another a",
  "03:13": "really interesting paper from the 2000s",
  "03:16": "looking at the UK's health care system",
  "03:20": "where they move to trying to have kind",
  "03:22": "of more metrics and then they found that",
  "03:25": "it's depressing they introduced new",
  "03:28": "targets around ER wait times and this",
  "03:31": "led to people cancelling scheduled",
  "03:33": "operations the hospitals would cancel",

  "03:52": "an ambulance outside the ER they turned",
  "03:56": "stretchers into beds by putting them in",
  "03:58": "hallways because then they could say the",
  "04:00": "person is no longer waiting there in a",
  "04:03": "quote bed and they also found a big",
  "04:06": "discrepancy in numbers reported by",
  "04:08": "fools versus by patience so if they",
  "04:10": "surveyed hospitals on how long people",
  "04:12": "were waiting they're getting different",
  "04:13": "results than if they survey patients on",
  "04:16": "how long did you wait and so this and",
  "04:21": "this is just kind of one of many",
  "04:23": "examples this report gives of how there",
  "04:26": "are unexpected kind of negative",
  "04:28": "consequences of this push to emphasize",
  "04:31": "numbers more and this is a mix of well I",
  "04:36": "guess I say this is a lot of kind of",
  "04:37": "gaming I mean some of the ones about the",
  "04:39": "the discrepancies in numbers some of",
  "04:41": "that can be I think",
  "04:43": "unintentional but people kind of knowing",
  "04:46": "what they need leads them to kind of",
  "04:47": "give answers that will line up with that",
  "04:51": "another example we've seen in the United",
  "04:53": "States of kind of manipulation in gaming",
  "04:56": "is that as more and more emphasis has",
  "04:57": "been put on standardized testing there",
  "05:00": "have been kind of widespread scandals of",
  "05:02": "school districts cheating so this is",
  "05:05": "where teachers or school administrators",
  "05:07": "are altering their students score our",
  "05:10": "answers to get higher scores and this",
  "05:13": "has happened in a number of states now",
  "05:15": "that kind of testing is so high-stakes",
  "05:17": "and I didn't include this and I don't",
  "05:22": "think I talked about this previously",
  "05:23": "there was a case that Cathy O'Neil",
  "05:26": "covers in her book weapons of mass",
  "05:28": "destruction and had been covered in the",
  "05:30": "I believe the Washington Post of a",
  "05:32": "teacher in either Virginia or DC that",
  "05:37": "was fired by an algorithm and her the",
  "05:42": "principal of her school loved her the",
  "05:44": "parents of her students really loved her",
  "05:46": "and she couldn't get a conclusive answer",
  "05:48": "of why she was fired but her suspicion",
  "05:51": "was that her students scores seemed",
  "05:54": "artificially high when the previous year",
  "05:57": "and they had kind of been at a different",
  "05:59": "school and then her students scores",
  "06:01": "dropped a kind of more normal levels",
  "06:03": "after her teaching and her teaching was",
  "06:06": "being evaluated",
  "06:07": "it's believed one of the factors is how",
  "06:10": "the students scores changed while they",
  "06:12": "were in her class and so there I feel",
  "06:15": "like it's kind of an intersection of two",
  "06:17": "negative trends you have the teachers",
  "06:19": "who most likely at the",
  "06:21": "previous school may have cheated because",
  "06:23": "they felt pressured to do so then when",
  "06:25": "she didn't then you have this other",
  "06:27": "algorithmic system that's firing",
  "06:29": "teachers based on these metrics and she",
  "06:32": "kind of ends up fired because of it so",
  "06:35": "that's kind of sobering sobering example",
  "06:39": "there was also an article on essay",
  "06:43": "grading software so there's this",
  "06:46": "software that grades essays is being",
  "06:47": "used and I think at least 22 states now",
  "06:49": "I was found that so the software focuses",
  "06:55": "on what you can measure right and we",
  "06:57": "can't measure everything that you can",
  "06:58": "measure sentence length and vocabulary",
  "07:00": "spelling subject verb agreement however",
  "07:04": "you can't measure creativity or novelty",
  "07:06": "or some more kind of abstract qualities",
  "07:09": "that can still be very important in",
  "07:11": "writing and so there was a computer",
  "07:14": "program that someone created that made",
  "07:17": "gibberish essays with sophisticated",
  "07:20": "words and sophisticated phrasing and",
  "07:22": "that got good scores it found the",
  "07:26": "research found that essays by",
  "07:28": "african-american students received lower",
  "07:30": "grades from the computer than from human",
  "07:33": "graders and essays by students from",
  "07:37": "mainland China received higher scores",
  "07:39": "from the computer than from expert human",
  "07:41": "graders which caused the researchers to",
  "07:44": "suspect that they may be using chunks of",
  "07:47": "pre memorized text so this is kind of",
  "07:49": "now we're combining what we learned",
  "07:51": "about with bias with a kind of this",
  "07:54": "example of overemphasizing metrics and",
  "07:57": "for me this kind of really strikes me",
  "07:59": "and that I I think of writing is",
  "08:01": "something that has a very intrinsically",
  "08:03": "human quality and that it's usually",
  "08:07": "humans communicating with humans but",
  "08:10": "here you know to have an example where a",
  "08:13": "computer program can generate a",
  "08:15": "gibberish essay that then will be",
  "08:17": "evaluated by another computer program",
  "08:19": "and receive you know receive a high",
  "08:21": "score but this also to me illustrates",
  "08:27": "some of the quad qualities that we can't",
  "08:30": "quantify and that we can't measure that",
  "08:32": "those tend to then not kind of be valued",
  "08:34": "if they can't be measured",
  "08:37": "this is an article just from the last",
  "08:39": "week about tik-tok marketing and so the",
  "08:45": "image is from Chipotle's hashtag burrito",
  "08:49": "campaign which was where you got a Half",
  "08:52": "Price burrito if you were a costume on",
  "08:55": "Halloween and tik-tok said hey this had",
  "08:58": "three point nine billion views that",
  "09:00": "sounds amazing that's a ton of use and",
  "09:03": "contrast",
  "09:04": "tik-tok has only been downloaded 145",
  "09:07": "million times in the USA this was a US",
  "09:09": "campaign so what what does this mean for",
  "09:12": "these numbers and tik-tok won't say kind",
  "09:17": "of how it classifies views but you have",
  "09:20": "a lot of a lot of companies put a lot of",
  "09:22": "importance on these metrics and it's",
  "09:24": "often kind of not clear how they're",
  "09:26": "gathered or even kind of what sense they",
  "09:28": "make in terms of impact or even how many",
  "09:32": "people actually saw saw this campaign",
  "09:35": "and so then people said that it reminded",
  "09:38": "them of when Facebook pivoted to video",
  "09:43": "several years but years ago Facebook",
  "09:47": "exaggerated video watch time by as much",
  "09:49": "as nine hundred percent was alleged by",
  "09:52": "one lawsuit so what happened was",
  "09:54": "Facebook said we know we're switching to",
  "09:57": "video and had these really positive",
  "09:59": "numbers of how much video was being",
  "10:01": "watched and so many news organizations",
  "10:03": "laid off journalists in response and",
  "10:07": "said oh you know we want to focus more",
  "10:08": "on our digital are on our video arms and",
  "10:11": "then it turns out that the numbers for",
  "10:13": "video were inflated and misleading there",
  "10:16": "was also kind of an air and and this is",
  "10:19": "something that there was a lawsuit about",
  "10:22": "that Facebook settled for 40 million",
  "10:25": "although that is just that was just",
  "10:27": "advertisers bringing suit so this",
  "10:29": "doesn't even impact all the kind of news",
  "10:34": "agencies and journalists that were",
  "10:35": "impacted because many of these",
  "10:37": "organizations laid off written",
  "10:39": "journalists because they wanted to put",
  "10:41": "more resources into video and then when",
  "10:43": "video turned out to not be as effective",
  "10:45": "than they laid off the video people they",
  "10:47": "had hired",
  "10:48": "it was kind of two rounds of layoffs but",
  "10:52": "capture is kind of how how much metrics",
  "10:54": "can drive kind of drive behavior of",
  "10:57": "organizations so there is an interesting",
  "11:04": "paper on the different failure modes of",
  "11:07": "good hearts law kind of breaking them",
  "11:10": "out into four categories so one is when",
  "11:14": "the difference between the proxy and the",
  "11:16": "goal is important and I think in almost",
  "11:18": "all cases we don't actually have the",
  "11:21": "data that we truly want what we have is",
  "11:22": "a proxy and sometimes that proxy is",
  "11:25": "closer than others but in cases where",
  "11:28": "the difference is significant that has",
  "11:30": "an impact and so that's what we saw was",
  "11:32": "kind of the health data about who had a",
  "11:35": "stroke there's extremel good heart where",
  "11:38": "the relationship between the proxy and",
  "11:40": "the goal is different when taken to an",
  "11:42": "extreme and so sometimes a kind of",
  "11:44": "relationship makes sense but once you",
  "11:47": "emphasize it that sends you kind of more",
  "11:49": "to an extreme where it's less where's",
  "11:53": "just a different relationship there can",
  "11:56": "be a non causal relationship between the",
  "11:58": "proxy and the goal and intervening on",
  "12:01": "one may fail to impact the other and",
  "12:04": "then there's also advert err adversaries",
  "12:07": "attempting to game your chosen proxy as",
  "12:10": "I thought this is kind of interesting as",
  "12:11": "a breakout of different different ways",
  "12:13": "that this can go wrong and we've talked",
  "12:21": "previously about YouTube's recommended",
  "12:24": "recommendation system Guillaume truss a",
  "12:26": "lot has a great post about this former a",
  "12:30": "kind of AI engineer at Google /youtube",
  "12:34": "and he quotes a YouTube blog post from",
  "12:37": "several years ago in which Google",
  "12:41": "Google's YouTube said if viewers are",
  "12:44": "watching more YouTube it signals to us",
  "12:45": "that they're happier with the content",
  "12:47": "they found it means that creators are",
  "12:49": "attracting more engaged audience it",
  "12:51": "opens up more opportunities to generate",
  "12:53": "revenue for our partners and so here",
  "12:56": "they're kind of boiling down that watch",
  "12:57": "time is about happiness and revenue",
  "13:01": "however I think we can",
  "13:02": "I'll think of times that we spend online",
  "13:05": "where we're not exactly happy and not",
  "13:08": "proud of how we've used our time",
  "13:09": "afterwards and I think this is kind of a",
  "13:12": "very very rough proxy and Guillaume does",
  "13:17": "a good job of kind of explaining how",
  "13:19": "also this ends up incentivizing content",
  "13:22": "that says that other platforms are lying",
  "13:24": "to you because you should spend more",
  "13:26": "time on the content from that platform",
  "13:29": "in order to maximize the watch time are",
  "13:37": "there questions so far on metrics Aaron",
  "13:42": "came past the catch box I had a question",
  "13:49": "about tick tock and we had opinions",
  "13:51": "about it and really China small comment",
  "13:59": "I love absolutely love Gary Vaynerchuk",
  "14:02": "because users don't think about the",
  "14:12": "number but it's it's so hard because",
  "14:14": "he's basically don't be a slave to the",
  "14:17": "algorithm but in fact Li like a walking",
  "14:20": "contradiction you're you're still making",
  "14:22": "money from like the the you know it's",
  "14:29": "like a two-sided like the thing that I",
  "14:32": "hear he's promoting take away I don't",
  "14:35": "know if yeah I'll table tick-tock that's",
  "14:38": "something we can discuss on the forums",
  "14:40": "and I don't feel like I've been it kind",
  "14:41": "of informed enough opinion on it yeah",
  "14:46": "and this issue of you know I Instagram",
  "14:48": "removing likes in certain countries I",
  "14:50": "mean there are there's still kind of",
  "14:52": "this asymmetry where Instagram is still",
  "14:56": "using that data on its side to promote",
  "14:58": "things and so then it's impacting people",
  "15:00": "in an opaque way although you also kind",
  "15:04": "of see the impact but I can definitely",
  "15:06": "recognize and myself how it influences",
  "15:08": "what I post on various networks kind of",
  "15:11": "seeing what gets shared and what people",
  "15:14": "respond to",
  "15:17": "yeah and that it actually that's",
  "15:19": "probably good example of what Ali was",
  "15:21": "mentioning of how people perform for",
  "15:23": "algorithms I definitely think there's a",
  "15:25": "sense and kind of in which people you",
  "15:26": "know can tailor tailor their content",
  "15:28": "based on what they think the algorithm",
  "15:31": "is going to reward what they think will",
  "15:32": "get kind of likes or views and I and I",
  "15:35": "think that can be very kind of insidious",
  "15:36": "like it's not necessarily alike no I'm",
  "15:39": "explicitly doing this just for the",
  "15:41": "algorithm but I think it does kind of",
  "15:43": "influence many of us another factor is",
  "15:52": "that our online environments I think are",
  "15:54": "designed to be very addictive the",
  "15:58": "incentives focus on short term metrics",
  "16:00": "and the fundamental business models",
  "16:02": "around manipulating people's behavior",
  "16:04": "and monopolizing their time and I think",
  "16:06": "you know kind of what we click like on",
  "16:08": "or what we retweet or share is often",
  "16:11": "used as this proxy of what we like but",
  "16:14": "it's you know it's what we like in a",
  "16:15": "very constrained and designed in a",
  "16:18": "specific way environment I don't know",
  "16:21": "that it's necessarily or in fact I don't",
  "16:23": "think it's getting it kind of like our",
  "16:24": "purist likes and you know I always think",
  "16:28": "I've kind of the example of reading a",
  "16:31": "long form journalism article that",
  "16:33": "potentially you know is harder to read",
  "16:35": "but months of research went into that",
  "16:37": "I'm gonna it's gonna help shape my",
  "16:40": "thinking on a topic and I may be glad",
  "16:42": "you know in the future that I read it",
  "16:44": "versus kind of the short-term impulse of",
  "16:46": "do I want to read something more catchy",
  "16:49": "and kind of easier to read in the moment",
  "16:51": "and I think we've gone through this with",
  "16:53": "the food industry and are a little bit",
  "16:55": "further along of a lot of junk food is",
  "16:58": "really appealing in the short term if",
  "17:00": "you don't think on a long term",
  "17:01": "perspective and then also depending on",
  "17:03": "how your environments designed as a",
  "17:05": "depth effect she uses the example of",
  "17:08": "cafeteria that's kind of actively",
  "17:10": "shoving junk food in our faces we're not",
  "17:12": "even having to reach for it it's kind of",
  "17:14": "being brought to us and so whenever we",
  "17:17": "think about kind of using metrics about",
  "17:19": "what people prefer to remember that",
  "17:21": "we're in this kind of very constrained",
  "17:23": "and short-term focused environment",
  "17:27": "and in the back corner had any thoughts",
  "17:40": "on the iPhone like stream time like how",
  "17:45": "weak now it's your phone and what the",
  "17:50": "relationship is to your previous the",
  "17:56": "idea of like where that idea came from",
  "17:59": "being receive that's a good yes I'm not",
  "18:03": "them following that closely I know that",
  "18:05": "I will say like the Tristan Harris's",
  "18:12": "time well-spent and totally blanking on",
  "18:15": "the name of Center for Humane technology",
  "18:17": "has promoted a lot of those kind of",
  "18:20": "design fixes of kind of what can we",
  "18:22": "change about design to to help people",
  "18:25": "and so that includes things of yeah like",
  "18:27": "tracking how long you're spending or",
