  "00:05": "the lesson on our ecosystem well so I",
  "00:10": "just briefly wanted to review what I was",
  "00:12": "talking about last week talked about",
  "00:14": "good hearts law when a measure becomes a",
  "00:17": "target it ceases to be a good measure",
  "00:19": "another variation of this is Campbell's",

  "00:31": "the social processes it's intended to",
  "00:33": "mirror to monitor and so I've written",
  "00:37": "about this more in a blog post and later",
  "00:40": "a paper that over emphasizing metrics",
  "00:42": "can lead to manipulation gaming my my",

  "01:09": "from England's health care system which",
  "01:11": "in the early 2000s implemented a number",
  "01:14": "of kind of performance metrics for",

  "02:13": "review about some of the issues with",
  "02:14": "metrics one of the readings from week",
  "02:17": "five that we didn't get to last time was",
  "02:20": "the platform is the message by James",

  "02:26": "talks about how kind of with meme",
  "02:30": "culture there's no example of a kind of",

  "02:42": "there's kind of this in-between and that",
  "02:44": "he gives this example about eating the",

  "02:50": "earliest mention of was this onion",
  "02:52": "article from 2015 which clearly seemed",

  "03:10": "he wrote online culture is awash in",
  "03:13": "layers of irony there's a sense in which",

  "03:19": "or a critique of the practice that is",
  "03:21": "not all also in part an advertisement",
  "03:23": "for it and then a quote I particularly",
  "03:27": "like is he highlighted that the",
  "03:29": "platform's are structurally at war with",
  "03:31": "themselves the same characteristics that",
  "03:34": "make outrageous and offensive content",
  "03:35": "unacceptable are what make it go viral",
  "03:38": "in the first place so I'd ask if there",
  "03:41": "are any kind of reactions to this paper",
  "03:43": "from last week anyone in the room all",
  "03:49": "right another paper I liked and I think",
  "03:53": "this was an optional reading was by Tom",
  "03:56": "sleeve incompatible incentives of",
  "03:58": "private sector AI and he talks about",
  "04:01": "this idea of the algorithm guardrail",
  "04:04": "arbitrage which is when a recommendation",
  "04:06": "system is promoting content that",
  "04:09": "violates its community guidelines so",
  "04:11": "they're the guardrails are kind of the",
  "04:13": "community guidelines of what's",
  "04:15": "unacceptable or should be taken down and",
  "04:18": "that often these things are in conflict",
  "04:21": "that",
  "04:22": "accomodation system is promoting",
  "04:24": "something that maybe technically is",
  "04:25": "against the the community guidelines",
  "04:28": "however companies have a financial",
  "04:30": "incentive to keep that gap wide and they",
  "04:32": "can kind of arbitrage across kind of you",
  "04:35": "know if they're called out pointing to",
  "04:37": "their guidelines of like oh no we don't",
  "04:39": "support this sort of thing yet",
  "04:41": "continuing to profit in instances where",
  "04:44": "they're they're not called out about it",
  "04:46": "and I thought that was a kind of helpful",
  "04:49": "helpful framing and again it points to",
  "04:52": "this kind of a structural tension or",
  "04:55": "even war of kind of the misaligned are",
  "05:00": "kind of different incentives depending",
  "05:02": "on your perspective",
  "05:06": "sleeo also writes about how social media",
  "05:09": "recommender algorithms have three",
  "05:11": "qualities needed for highly elastic but",
  "05:15": "also highly fragile systems those are",
  "05:18": "that experimentation is very affordable",
  "05:20": "so people can you know automatically uh",
  "05:23": "automate generating content and just put",
  "05:25": "a ton of content out there and see",
  "05:27": "what's rewarded what's not they get fast",
  "05:30": "feedback in the forms of likes and views",
  "05:34": "and it has a high impact on the",
  "05:36": "recommendation system and these three",
  "05:38": "qualities kind of all really encourage",
  "05:41": "gaming and manipulation because they",
  "05:43": "make it make a cheap and efficient to do",
  "05:45": "so alright me check the the group chat",
  "05:52": "to see any comments someone said they",
  "05:57": "really liked this paper a great",
  "05:59": "explanation of meme culture any comments",
  "06:05": "from in person alright so the the next",
  "06:13": "set of things I want to talk about is to",
  "06:16": "kind of understand broadly some of the",
  "06:19": "forces at work in tech particularly",
  "06:22": "venture capital hyper growth and",
  "06:24": "blitzscaling and so I think it's",
  "06:27": "important to understand these to kind of",
  "06:29": "understand the patterns of why we keep",
  "06:31": "seeing companies that",
  "06:33": "have some of the same ethical pitfalls",
  "06:35": "this reminds me a little bit of Zeynep",
  "06:38": "defect ease article on sociological",
  "06:41": "storytelling but understanding some of",
  "06:43": "the kind of sociological forces that",
  "06:46": "have led to kind of our current or",
  "06:48": "current state and so I've written a",
  "06:51": "little bit in a different context there",
  "06:53": "at a blog post two years ago and and I",
  "06:57": "want to highlight everything I'm saying",
  "06:58": "as a generality like they're definitely",
  "07:00": "exceptions to these but on the whole I",
  "07:03": "think there are a lot of downsides to",
  "07:05": "venture capital into hyper growth and",
  "07:08": "this is not to say that they're never",
  "07:10": "useful or they're no cases where they're",
  "07:12": "where they're helpful I think they",
  "07:16": "adventure capital in many cases can push",
  "07:18": "what could have been a successful kind",
  "07:20": "of sustainable business to over expand",
  "07:22": "and ultimately fail and that there's",
  "07:25": "often a lot of misalignment of",
  "07:27": "incentives between VCS and founders and",
  "07:30": "the rest of society more broadly and so",
  "07:34": "this is kind of showing up in the media",
  "07:36": "more here's a venture capitalist saying",
  "07:38": "that the vast majority of entrepreneurs",
  "07:40": "should not take venture capital because",
  "07:42": "it's a binary swing for the fences",
  "07:44": "exercising exercise there was a New York",
  "07:48": "Times article on more entrepreneurs that",
  "07:51": "are just not even interested in in",
  "07:53": "venture capital and so Tim O'Reilly",
  "07:57": "talks about kind of a lot of related",
  "07:59": "issues in his post that was a sign",
  "08:01": "reading last week and kind of the the",
  "08:05": "premise of our kind of current system is",
  "08:09": "that if a company grows big enough and",
  "08:11": "fast enough that profits will eventually",
  "08:13": "follow so kind of if you can just get",
  "08:15": "really big really fast like it's gonna",
  "08:18": "have to work out that you're profitable",
  "08:19": "is the the hypothesis and kind of one",
  "08:25": "philosophy this goes under is",
  "08:27": "blitzscaling which read Hoffman and",
  "08:30": "Christie write a book on and it really",
  "08:32": "prioritizes speed over efficiency and",
  "08:35": "risk potentially disastrous defeat but",
  "08:38": "the idea that there's a lot of upsides",
  "08:40": "if you're a successful and Tim O'Reilly",
  "08:44": "is very critical of this approach and",
  "08:46": "is in his article and so first just how",
  "08:51": "is the how is this related to data",
  "08:53": "ethics and what we're talking about I'm",
  "08:56": "having this kind of hyper growth",
  "08:57": "typically requires automation and",
  "09:00": "reliance on metrics this isn't something",
  "09:02": "you can kind of do just just using",
  "09:05": "people or human decision-makers you",
  "09:07": "typically are going to be having to use",
  "09:09": "a lot of automation and data - I think",
  "09:13": "that prioritizing speed above all else",
  "09:15": "doesn't leave time to reflect on ethics",
  "09:18": "and then when you do have problems they",
  "09:21": "happen at a large scale and so I think",
  "09:23": "if if a company is kind of growing in a",
  "09:26": "more sustainable manner",
  "09:27": "you know you there might be a problem",
  "09:29": "but you can recognize it when the",
  "09:30": "company is still small and before it's",
  "09:32": "impacted too many people if you kind of",
  "09:34": "grow at a very fast scale your problem",
  "09:39": "may be impacting millions of people",
  "09:40": "before before it becomes apparent ok",
  "09:45": "pause here I'll check the a group chat",
  "09:56": "can you explain a little bit more about",
  "09:58": "why it's important to have high",
  "10:00": "elasticity",
  "10:01": "I had trouble understanding of the",
  "10:03": "concept oh sorry about that there is a",
  "10:07": "so that's going back there's a little",
  "10:09": "bit of late latency with the YouTube",
  "10:11": "stream so let me go back to the slide on",
  "10:16": "elasticity and so actually what this was",
  "10:20": "saying that is that high elasticity is a",
  "10:25": "risk so it's associated with high",
  "10:29": "fragility and so kind of the fact that",
  "10:31": "people can experiment so easily this is",
  "10:34": "actually a bad thing just because it",
  "10:36": "leads to a lot of gaming and",
  "10:38": "manipulation and so this was kind of",
  "10:43": "painting it in a negative light of kind",
  "10:46": "of what the risk are of kind of being so",
  "10:48": "elastic because the the recommendation",
  "10:51": "system is really responding quickly and",
  "10:55": "content creators are responding quickly",
  "10:58": "in terms of creating lots of content and",
  "11:00": "this feedback the system can change very",
  "11:02": "quickly but these same factors are what",
  "11:05": "lead to to manipulation and so let me go",
  "11:09": "back to the the chat and so yeah let me",
  "11:15": "know if that explanation was helpful in",
  "11:17": "the chat and I'll move on to some of the",
  "11:19": "other comments one person said as a VC I",
  "11:23": "agree with these points about venture",
  "11:25": "capital uber lyft it's gonna be a good",
  "11:32": "case study they bootstrap for growth",
  "11:34": "without profit bill without",
  "11:36": "profitability what happens now and I",
  "11:41": "think on the kind of uber lyft example",
  "11:44": "something that was to me kind of odd to",
  "11:47": "see is I there were you know there were",
  "11:50": "cities and areas where uber and lyft",
  "11:53": "could be profitable but because they",
  "11:54": "were going for this particular uber for",
  "11:57": "this kind of world domination approach",
  "11:58": "they you know did end up trying to",
  "12:02": "compete in a number of markets where",
  "12:04": "they were just constantly losing money",
  "12:06": "and that they did ultimately pull out of",
  "12:08": "particularly in Asia I know so I think",
  "12:11": "there's already kind of been a cost to",
  "12:13": "that another comment can also state that",
  "12:18": "more and more a I powered startups build",
  "12:20": "data products and don't think about",
  "12:22": "ethical applications during the building",
  "12:24": "and testing phases someone says I love",
  "12:28": "the long term ism movement such as long",
  "12:31": "now",
  "12:32": "FHI at Oxford for these kinds of reasons",
  "12:36": "kind of the opposite of moving fast and",
  "12:38": "breaking things ideologically so those",
  "12:41": "are some comments from the chat any",
  "12:44": "comments from in person alright so going",
  "12:50": "back yeah so we've kind of said there's",
  "12:52": "this relationship I think between hyper",
  "12:54": "growth and automation and using data and",
  "12:56": "also making it harder for people to",
  "12:59": "reflect on the ethics of what they're",
  "13:00": "doing some other characteristics of what",
  "13:04": "happens are that investors end up kind",
  "13:07": "of anointing winners as opposed to",
  "13:08": "market forces tends to create duopoly",
  "13:11": "Zoar monopolies",
  "13:14": "it's incredibly difficult for new",
  "13:16": "entrants there's a loss of control of",
  "13:20": "the company often by founders companies",
  "13:25": "can tend to spread themselves too thin",
  "13:26": "in trying to achieve this you know kind",
  "13:30": "of global monopoly status and tons of",
  "13:34": "companies using the strategy fail and so",
  "13:37": "there's real survivorship bias in the",
  "13:41": "success stories we hear and kind of an",
  "13:43": "advice that you get from from VCS always",
  "13:47": "be aware of kind of the survivorship",
  "13:48": "bias of they're focusing on the few the",
  "13:50": "few that were successful however many",
  "13:53": "many companies fail and I think that",
  "13:56": "kind of taking venture capital in many",
  "13:58": "cases can push what could have been a",
  "14:00": "kind of successful but small sustainable",
  "14:04": "company kind of to this brink of failure",
  "14:10": "one of the subject headings in O'Reilly",
  "14:13": "article was is it a business or a",
  "14:15": "financial instrument and he shares this",
  "14:18": "graph which i think is just remarkable",
  "14:21": "of the percent of US IPOs with negative",
  "14:25": "earnings per share at the time of IPO",
  "14:27": "and you can see it is above 80%",
  "14:31": "currently so this really high number of",
  "14:34": "companies going public that are losing",
  "14:37": "money at the time they go public so kind",
  "14:41": "not having achieved a profitable",
  "14:43": "business and if you look back kind of",
  "14:46": "the only time it's been nearly as high",
  "14:47": "was in 2004 the previous calm crash but",
  "14:52": "that kind of historically it was at much",
  "14:54": "lower number numbers",
  "14:59": "quote from the article Silicon Valley",
  "15:01": "venture capitalists want entrepreneurs",
  "15:03": "to pursue exponential growth even if",
  "15:06": "doing so costs more money and increases",
  "15:08": "the chances that the business will fail",
  "15:13": "so then there's um now I'm getting into",
  "15:15": "the kind of this ain't it affect the",
  "15:17": "articles she talks about and I think",
  "15:19": "this is just kind of so prescient of her",
  "15:21": "that she in twenty twelve was already",
  "15:24": "really concerned about the growth of the",
  "15:27": "kind of the data-driven campaign in the",
  "15:30": "harms of that at a time when many people",
  "15:33": "were thinking that big data would save",
  "15:36": "politics the data had you know played a",
  "15:39": "significant role in the Obama Obama",
  "15:42": "campaign and in zeyneb says she got a",
  "15:45": "lot of negative negative feedback for",
  "15:48": "her her New York Times op-ed at the time",
  "15:50": "expressing hesitation about this and so",
  "15:57": "she she talks about how he kind of went",
  "15:59": "from data seeming you know it should be",
  "16:02": "this really kind of positive hopeful",
  "16:04": "things so it helped Obama get elected it",
  "16:06": "was helping people you know kind of",
  "16:09": "revolt against dictators to now seeing",
  "16:13": "it is having a lot of oppressive",
  "16:16": "repressive results digital platforms",
  "16:19": "allowed communities to gather and form",
  "16:21": "in new ways but they also dispersed",
  "16:23": "existing communities then a quote that I",
  "16:28": "think about a lot is power always learns",
  "16:30": "and powerful tools always fall into its",
  "16:33": "hands this is a hard lesson of history",
  "16:36": "but a solid one and so that initially",
  "16:38": "kind of even though many people whose",
  "16:40": "voices you know hadn't been as widely",
  "16:43": "heard were able to find a platform",
  "16:46": "through through social media and",
  "16:47": "technology which was very positive we're",
  "16:50": "now seeing the powerful kind of",
  "16:51": "manipulated in some harmful ways and",
  "16:53": "this kind of rereading this article by",
  "16:58": "by Zeynep reminded me of our mediating",
  "17:02": "consent article that we read in the",
  "17:03": "first week and they are ranae de Resta",
  "17:06": "in the context of disinformation talked",
  "17:09": "about the shift from in other ways",
  "17:12": "the kind of the mainstream centralized",

  "17:18": "enough investigation around the Vietnam",
  "17:20": "War and the the downsides there also",
  "17:23": "with the Iraq war kind of not pointing",
  "17:26": "out the kind of flimsy and false",

  "17:51": "the chat yeah and so the MIT check",
  "18:02": "article by Dana pal social media took us",
  "18:06": "from to here Square to Donald Trump",
